<h2>Georgina of the Rainbows</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HER EARLIER MEMORIES</div>


<div class='cap'>IF old Jeremy Clapp had not sneezed his teeth
into the fire that winter day this story might have
had a more seemly beginning; but, being a true record,
it must start with that sneeze, because it was the
first happening in Georgina Huntingdon's life which
she could remember distinctly.</div>

<p>She was in her high-chair by a window overlooking
a gray sea, and with a bib under her chin, was
being fed dripping spoonfuls of bread and milk from
the silver porringer which rested on the sill. The
bowl was almost on a level with her little blue shoes
which she kept kicking up and down on the step of
her high-chair, wherefore the restraining hand which
seized her ankles at intervals. It was Mrs. Triplett's
firm hand which clutched her, and Mrs. Triplett's
firm hand which fed her, so there was not the
usual dilly-dallying over Georgina's breakfast as
when her mother held the spoon. She always made a
game of it, chanting nursery rhymes in a gay, silver-bell-cockle-shell
sort of way, as if she were one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the "pretty maids all in a row," just stepped out of
a picture book.</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett was an elderly widow, a distant relative
of the family, who lived with them. "Tippy"
the child called her before she could speak plainly&mdash;a
foolish name for such a severe and dignified person,
but Mrs. Triplett rather seemed to like it. Being
the working housekeeper, companion and everything
else which occasion required, she had no time to make
a game of Georgina's breakfast, even if she had
known how. Not once did she stop to say, "Curly-locks,
Curly-locks, wilt thou be mine?" or to press
her face suddenly against Georgina's dimpled rose-leaf
cheek as if it were <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'somthing'">something</ins> too temptingly dear
and sweet to be resisted. She merely said, "Here!"
each time she thrust the spoon towards her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett was in an especial hurry this morning,
and did not even look up when old Jeremy came
into the room to put more wood on the fire. In winter,
when there was no garden work, Jeremy did
everything about the house which required a man's
hand. Although he must have been nearly eighty
years old, he came in, tall and unbending, with a big
log across his shoulder. He walked stiffly, but his
back was as straight as the long poker with which
he mended the fire.</p>

<p>Georgina had seen him coming and going about
the place every day since she had been brought to
live in this old gray house beside the sea, but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was the first time he had made any lasting impression
upon her memory. Henceforth, she was to carry
with her as long as she should live the picture of a
hale, red-faced old man with a woolen muffler wound
around his lean throat. His knitted "wrist-warmers"
slipped down over his mottled, deeply-veined
hands when he stooped to roll the log into the fire.
He let go with a grunt. The next instant a mighty
sneeze seized him, and Georgina, who had been gazing
in fascination at the shower of sparks he was
making, saw all of his teeth go flying into the fire.</p>

<p>If his eyes had suddenly dropped from their sockets
upon the hearth, or his ears floated off from the
sides of his head, she could not have been more terrified,
for she had not yet learned that one's teeth
may be a separate part of one's anatomy. It was
such a terrible thing to see a man go to pieces in
this undreamed-of fashion, that she began to scream
and writhe around in her high-chair until it nearly
turned over.</p>

<p>She did upset the silver porringer, and what was
left of the bread and milk splashed out on the floor,
barely missing the rug. Mrs. Triplett sprang to
snatch her from the toppling chair, thinking the child
was having a spasm. She did not connect it with old
Jeremy's sneeze until she heard his wrathful gibbering,
and turned to see him holding up the teeth,
which he had fished out of the fire with the tongs.</p>

<p>They were an old-fashioned set such as one never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sees now. They had been made in England. They
were hinged together like jaws, and Georgina yelled
again as she saw them all blackened and gaping,
dangling from the tongs. It was not the grinning
teeth themselves, however, which frightened her.
It was the awful knowledge, vague though it was to
her infant mind, that a human body could fly apart
in that way. And Tippy, not understanding the
cause of her terror, never thought to explain that
they were false and had been made by a man in
some out-of-the-way corner of Yorkshire, instead
of by the Almighty, and that their removal was painless.</p>

<p>It was several years before Georgina learned the
truth, and the impression made by the accident grew
into a lurking fear which often haunted her as time
wore on. She never knew at what moment she might
fly apart herself. That it was a distressing experience
she knew from the look on old Jeremy's
face and the desperate pace at which he set off to
have himself mended.</p>

<p>She held her breath long enough to hear the door
bang shut after him and his hob-nailed shoes go
scrunch, scrunch, through the gravel of the path
around the house, then she broke out crying again
so violently that Tippy had hard work quieting her.
She picked up the silver porringer from the floor
and told her to look at the pretty bowl. The fall
had put a dent into its side. And what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Georgina's great-great aunt have said could she have
known what was going to happen to her handsome
dish, poor lady! Surely she never would have left it
to such a naughty namesake! Then, to stop her
sobbing, Mrs. Triplett took one tiny finger-tip in her
large ones, and traced the name which was engraved
around the rim in tall, slim-looped letters: the name
which had passed down through many christenings
to its present owner, "Georgina Huntingdon."</p>

<p>Failing thus to pacify the frightened child, Mrs.
Triplett held her up to the window overlooking the
harbor, and dramatically bade her "hark!" Standing
with her blue shoes on the window-sill, and a tear
on each pink cheek, Georgina flattened her nose
against the glass and obediently listened.</p>

<p>The main street of the ancient seaport town, upon
which she gazed expectantly, curved three miles
around the harbor, and the narrow board-walk which
ran along one side of it all the way, ended abruptly
just in front of the house in a waste of sand. So
there was nothing to be seen but a fishing boat at
anchor, and the waves crawling up the beach, and
nothing to be heard but the jangle of a bell somewhere
down the street. The sobs broke out again.</p>

<p>"Hush!" commanded Mrs. Triplett, giving her
an impatient shake. "Hark to what's coming up
along. Can't you stop a minute and give the Towncrier
a chance? Or is it you're trying to outdo him?"</p>

<p>The word "Towncrier" was meaningless to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Georgina. There was nothing by that name in her
linen book which held the pictures of all the animals
from Ape to Zebra, and there was nothing by that
name down in Kentucky where she had lived all of
her short life until these last few weeks. She did
not even know whether what Mrs. Triplett said was
coming along would be wearing a hat or horns. The
cow that lowed at the pasture bars every night back
in Kentucky jangled a bell. Georgina had no distinct
recollection of the cow, but because of it the
sound of a bell was associated in her mind with horns.
So horns were what she halfway expected to see, as
she watched breathlessly, with her face against the
glass.</p>

<p>"Hark to what he's calling!" urged Mrs. Triplett.
"A fish auction. There's a big boat in this morning
with a load of fish, and the Towncrier is telling everybody
about it."</p>

<p>So a Towncrier was a man! The next instant
Georgina saw him. He was an old man, with bent
shoulders and a fringe of gray hair showing under
the fur cap pulled down to meet his ears. But there
was such a happy twinkle in his faded blue eyes, such
goodness of heart in every wrinkle of the weather-beaten
old face, that even the grumpiest people
smiled a little when they met him, and everybody he
spoke to stepped along a bit more cheerful, just because
the hearty way he said "<i>Good</i> morning!" made
the day seem really good.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's cold," said Tippy. "Let's tap on the window
and beckon him to come in and warm himself
before he starts back to town."</p>

<p>She caught up Georgina's hand to make it do the
tapping, thinking it would please her to give her a
share in the invitation, but in her touchy frame of
mind it was only an added grievance to have her
knuckles knocked against the pane, and her wails
began afresh as the old man, answering the signal,
shook his bell at her playfully, and turned towards
the house.</p>

<p>As to what happened after that, Georgina's memory
is a blank, save for a confused recollection of
being galloped to Banbury Cross on somebody's
knee, while a big hand helped her to clang the clapper
of a bell far too heavy for her to swing alone.
But some dim picture of the kindly face puckered into
smiles for her comforting, stayed on in her mind as
an object seen through a fog, and thereafter she
never saw the Towncrier go kling-klanging along the
street without feeling a return of that same sense of
safety which his song gave her that morning. Somehow,
it restored her confidence in all Creation which
Jeremy's teeth had shattered in their fall.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of Georgina's contentment at
being settled on the visitor's knee, Mrs. Triplett hurried
for a cloth to wipe up the bread and milk.
Kneeling on the floor beside it she sopped it up so
energetically that what she was saying came in jerks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a mercy you happened along, Mr. Darcy, or
she might have been screaming yet. I never saw a
child go into such a sudden tantrum."</p>

<p>The answer came in jerks also, for it took a vigorous
trotting of the knees to keep such a heavy child
as Georgina on the bounce. And in order that his
words might not interfere with the game he sang
them to the tune of "Ride a Cock Horse."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>There must have been&mdash;some very good&mdash;&mdash;</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Reason for such&mdash;a hulla-ba-loo!</i>"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I'll tell you when I come back," said Mrs. Triplett,
on her feet again by this time and halfway to
the kitchen with the dripping floor cloth. But when
she reappeared in the doorway her own concerns had
crowded out the thought of old Jeremy's misfortune.</p>

<p>"My yeast is running all over the top of the crock,
Mr. Darcy, and if I don't get it mixed right away
the whole baking will be spoiled."</p>

<p>"That's all right, ma'am," was the answer. "Go
ahead with your dough. I'll keep the little lass out
of mischief. Many's the time I have sat by this fire
with her father on my knee, as you know. But it's
been years since I was in this room last."</p>

<p>There was a long pause in the Banbury Cross ride.
The Crier was looking around the room from one
familiar object to another with the gentle wistfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
which creeps into old eyes when they peer into
the past for something that has ceased to be.
Georgina grew impatient.</p>

<p>"More ride!" she commanded, waving her hands
and clucking her tongue as he had just taught her to
do.</p>

<p>"Don't let her worry you, Mr. Darcy," called
Mrs. Triplett from the kitchen. "Her mother will
be back from the post-office most any minute now.
Just send her out here to me if she gets too bothersome."</p>

<p>Instantly Georgina cuddled her head down against
his shoulder. She had no mind to be separated
from this new-found playfellow. When he produced
a battered silver watch from the pocket of his velveteen
waistcoat, holding it over her ear, she was
charmed into a prolonged silence. The clack of
Tippy's spoon against the crock came in from the
kitchen, and now and then the fire snapped or the
green fore-log made a sing-song hissing.</p>

<p>More than thirty years had passed by since the
old Towncrier first visited the Huntingdon home.
He was not the Towncrier then, but a seafaring man
who had sailed many times around the globe, and
had his fill of adventure. Tired at last of such a
roving life, he had found anchorage to his liking
in this quaint old fishing town at the tip end of Cape
Cod. Georgina's grandfather, George Justin Huntingdon,
a judge and a writer of dry law books, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
been one of the first to open his home to him. They
had been great friends, and little Justin, now Georgina's
father, had been a still closer friend. Many a
day they had spent together, these two, fishing or
blueberrying or tramping across the dunes. The boy
called him "Uncle Darcy," tagging after him like a
shadow, and feeling a kinship in their mutual love of
adventure which drew as strongly as family ties.
The Judge always said that it was the old sailor's
yarns of sea life which sent Justin into the navy "instead
of the law office where he belonged."</p>

<p>As the old man looked down at Georgina's soft,
brown curls pressed against his shoulder, and felt
her little dimpled hand lying warm on his neck, he
could almost believe it was the same child who had
crept into his heart thirty years ago. It was hard to
think of the little lad as grown, or as filling the responsible
position of a naval surgeon. Yet when he
counted back he realized that the Judge had been
dead several years, and the house had been standing
empty all that time. Justin had never been back
since it was boarded up. He had written occasionally
during the first of his absence, but only boyish
scrawls which told little about himself.</p>

<p>The only real news which the old man had of him
was in the three clippings from the Provincetown
<i>Beacon</i>, which he carried about in his wallet. The
first was a mention of Justin's excellent record in
fighting a fever epidemic in some naval station in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
tropics. The next was the notice of his marriage to
a Kentucky girl by the name of Barbara Shirley, and
the last was a paragraph clipped from a newspaper
dated only a few weeks back. It said that Mrs. Justin
Huntingdon and little daughter, Georgina, would
arrive soon to take possession of the old Huntingdon
homestead which had been closed for many
years. During the absence of her husband, serving
in foreign parts, she would have with her Mrs. Maria
Triplett.</p>

<p>The Towncrier had known Mrs. Triplett as long
as he had known the town. She had been kind to
him when he and his wife were in great trouble. He
was thinking about that time now, because it had
something to do with his last visit to the Judge in
this very room. She had happened to be present,
too. And the green fore-log had made that same
sing-song hissing. The sound carried his thoughts
back so far that for a few moments he ceased to hear
the clack of the spoon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GEORGINA'S PLAYMATE MOTHER</div>


<div class='cap'>AS the Towncrier's revery brought him around to
Mrs. Triplett's part in the painful scene which
he was recalling, he heard her voice, and looking up,
saw that she had come back into the room, and was
standing by the window.</div>

<p>"There's Justin's wife now, Mr. Darcy, coming
up the beach. Poor child, she didn't get her letter.
I can tell she's disappointed from the way she walks
along as if she could hardly push against the wind."</p>

<p>The old man, leaning sideways over the arm of his
chair, craned his neck toward the window to peer
out, but he did it without dislodging Georgina, who
was repeating the "tick-tick" of the watch in a whisper,
as she lay contentedly against the Towncrier's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"She's naught but a slip of a girl," he commented,
referring to Georgina's mother, slowly drawing into
closer view. "She must be years younger than Justin.
She came up to me in the post-office last week
and told me who she was, and I've been intending
ever since to get up this far to talk with her about
him."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>As they watched her she reached the end of the
board-walk, and plunging ankle-deep into the sand,
trudged slowly along as if pushed back by the wind.
It whipped her skirts about her and blew the ends
of her fringed scarf back over her shoulder. She
made a bright flash of color against the desolate
background. Scarf, cap and thick knitted reefer
were all of a warm rose shade. Once she stopped,
and with hands thrust into her reefer pockets, stood
looking off towards the lighthouse on Long Point.
Mrs. Triplett spoke again, still watching her.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to take Justin's offer when he first
wrote to me, although the salary he named was a
good one, and I knew the work wouldn't be more
than I've always been used to. But I had planned
to stay in Wellfleet this winter, and it always goes
against the grain with me to have to change a plan
once made. I only promised to stay until she was
comfortably settled. A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Portugese'">Portuguese</ins> woman on one
of the back streets would have come and cooked for
her. But land! When I saw how strange and lonesome
she seemed and how she turned to me for
everything, I didn't have the heart to say go. I
only named it once to her, and she sort of choked up
and winked back the tears and said in that soft-spoken
Southern way of hers, 'Oh, don't leave me,
Tippy!' She's taken to calling me Tippy, just as
Georgina does. 'When you talk about it I feel like
a kitten shipwrecked on a desert island. It's all so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
strange and dreadful here with just sea on one side
and sand dunes on the other.'"</p>

<p>At the sound of her name, Georgina suddenly sat
up straight and began fumbling the watch back into
the velveteen pocket. She felt that it was time for
her to come into the foreground again.</p>

<p>"More ride!" she demanded. The galloping
began again, gently at first, then faster and faster
in obedience to her wishes, until she seemed only a
swirl of white dress and blue ribbon and flying brown
curls. But this time the giddy going up and down
was in tame silence. There was no accompanying
song to make the game lively. Mrs. Triplett had
more to say, and Mr. Darcy was too deeply interested
to sing.</p>

<p>"Look at her now, stopping to read that sign set
up on the spot where the Pilgrims landed. She does
that every time she passes it. Says it cheers her up
something wonderful, no matter how downhearted
she is, to think that she wasn't one of the Mayflower
passengers, and that she's nearly three hundred years
away from their hardships and that dreadful first
wash-day of theirs. Does seem to me though, that's
a poor way to make yourself cheerful, just thinking
of all the hard times you might have had but didn't."</p>

<p>"<i>Thing</i> it!" lisped Georgina, wanting undivided
attention, and laying an imperious little hand on his
cheek to force it. "<i>Thing!</i>"</p>

<p>He shook his head reprovingly, with a finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
across his lips to remind her that Mrs. Triplett was
still talking; but she was not to be silenced in such
a way. Leaning over until her mischievous brown
eyes compelled him to look at her, she smiled like
a dimpled cherub. Georgina's smile was something
irresistible when she wanted her own way.</p>

<p>"<i>Pleathe!</i>" she lisped, her face so radiantly sure
that no one could be hardhearted enough to resist the
magic appeal of that word, that he could not disappoint
her.</p>

<p>"The little witch!" he exclaimed. "She could
wheedle the fish out of the sea if she'd say please
to 'em that way. But how that honey-sweet tone and
the yells she was letting loose awhile back could
come out of that same little rose of a mouth, passes
my understanding."</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett had left them again and he was
singing at the top of his quavering voice, "Rings on
her fingers and bells on her toes," when the front
door opened and Georgina's mother came in. The
salt wind had blown color into her cheeks as bright
as her rose-pink reefer. Her disappointment about
the letter had left a wistful shadow in her big gray
eyes, but it changed to a light of pleasure when she
saw who was romping with Georgina. They were
so busy with their game that neither of them noticed
her entrance.</p>

<p>She closed the door softly behind her and stood
with her back against it watching them a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Then Georgina spied her, and with a rapturous cry
of <i>"Barby!"</i> scrambled down and ran to throw herself
into her mother's arms. Barby was her way of
saying Barbara. It was the first word she had ever
spoken and her proud young mother encouraged her
to repeat it, even when her Grandmother Shirley insisted
that it wasn't respectful for a child to call its
mother by her first name.</p>

<p>"But I don't care whether it is or not," Barbara
had answered. "All I want is for her to feel that
we're the best chums in the world. And I'm <i>not</i> going
to spoil her even if I am young and inexperienced.
There are a few things that I expect to be very strict
about, but making her respectful to me isn't one of
them."</p>

<p>Now one of the things which Barbara had decided
to be very strict about in Georgina's training was
making her respectful to guests. She was not to
thrust herself upon their notice, she was not to interrupt
their conversation, or make a nuisance of herself.
So, young as she was, Georgina had already
learned what was expected of her, when her mother
having greeted Mr. Darcy and laid aside her wraps,
drew up to the fire to talk to him. But instead of
doing the expected thing, Georgina did the forbidden.
Since the old man's knees were crossed so that
she could no longer climb upon them, she attempted
to seat herself on his foot, clamoring, "Do it again!"</p>

<p>"No, dear," Barbara said firmly. "Uncle Darcy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
tired." She had noticed the long-drawn sigh of relief
with which he ended the last gallop. "He's
going to tell us about father when he was a little boy
no bigger than you. So come here to Barby and
listen or else go off to your own corner and play
with your whirligig."</p>

<p>Usually, at the mention of some particularly pleasing
toy Georgina would trot off happily to find it;
but to-day she stood with her face drawn into a rebellious
pucker and scowled at her mother savagely.
Then throwing herself down on the rug she began
kicking her blue shoes up and down on the hearth,
roaring, "<i>No! No!</i>" at the top of her voice. Barbara
paid no attention at first, but finding it impossible
to talk with such a noise going on, dragged her
up from the floor and looked around helplessly, considering
what to do with her. Then she remembered
the huge wicker clothes hamper, standing empty in
the kitchen, and carrying her out, gently lowered her
into it.</p>

<p>It was so deep that even on tiptoe Georgina could
not look over the rim. All she could see was the
ceiling directly overhead. The surprise of such a
novel punishment made her hold her breath to find
what was going to happen next, and in the stillness
she heard her mother say calmly as she walked out of
the room: "If she roars any more, Tippy, just put
the lid on; but as soon as she is ready to act like a
little lady, lift her out, please."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The strangeness of her surroundings kept her quiet
a moment longer, and in that moment she discovered
that by putting one eye to a loosely-woven spot in the
hamper she could see what Mrs. Triplett was doing.
She was polishing the silver porringer, trying to rub
out the dent which the fall had made in its side. It
was such an interesting kitchen, seen through this
peep-hole that Georgina became absorbed in rolling
her eye around for wider views. Then she found
another outlook on the other side of the hamper,
and was quiet so long that Mrs. Triplett came over
and peered down at her to see what was the matter.
Georgina looked up at her with a roguish smile.
One never knew how she was going to take a punishment
or what she would do next.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to be a little lady now? Want me
to lift you out?" Both little arms were stretched joyously
up to her, and a voice of angelic sweetness said
coaxingly: "<i>Pleathe</i>, Tippy."</p>

<p>The porringer was in Mrs. Triplett's hand when
she leaned over the hamper to ask the question. The
gleam of its freshly-polished sides caught Georgina's
attention an instant before she was lifted out, and
it was impressed on her memory still more deeply
by being put into her own hands afterwards as she
sat in Mrs. Triplett's lap. Once more her tiny finger's
tip was made to trace the letters engraved
around the rim, as she was told about her great-great
aunt and what was expected of her. The solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tone clutched her attention as firmly as the hand
which held her, and somehow, before she was set
free, she was made to feel that because of that old
porringer she was obliged to be a little lady.</p>

<p>Tippy was not one who could sit calmly by and
see a child suffer for lack of proper instruction, and
while Georgina never knew just how it was done, the
fact was impressed upon her as years went by that
there were many things which she could not do,
simply because she was a Huntingdon and because
her name had been graven for so many generations
around that shining silver rim.</p>

<p>Although to older eyes the happenings of that
morning were trivial, they were far-reaching in their
importance to Georgina, for they gave her three
memories&mdash;Jeremy's teeth, the Towncrier's bell, and
her own name on the porringer&mdash;to make a deep impression
on all her after-life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TOWNCRIER HAS HIS SAY</div>


<div class='cap'>THE old Huntingdon house with its gray gables
and stone chimneys, stood on the beach near the
breakwater, just beyond the place where everything
seemed to come to an end. The house itself marked
the end of the town. Back of it the dreary dunes
stretched away toward the Atlantic, and in front the
Cape ran out in a long, thin tongue of sand between
the bay and the harbor, with a lighthouse on its
farthest point. It gave one the feeling of being at
the very tip end of the world to look across and see
the water closing in on both sides. Even the road
ended in front of the house in a broad loop in which
machines could turn around.</div>

<p>In summer there was always a string of sightseers
coming up to this end of the beach. They came to
read the tablet erected on the spot known to Georgina
as "holy ground," because it marked the first
landing of the Pilgrims. Long before she could read,
Mrs. Triplett taught her to lisp part of a poem which
said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Aye, call it holy ground,</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>The thoil where firth they trod.</i>"</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>She taught it to Georgina because she thought it
was only fair to Justin that his child should grow
up to be as proud of her New England home as she
was of her Southern one. Barbara was always singing
to her about "My Old Kentucky Home," and
"Going Back to Dixie," and when they played together
on the beach their favorite game was building
Grandfather Shirley's house in the sand.</p>

<p>Day after day they built it up with shells and
wet sand and pebbles, even to the stately gate posts
topped by lanterns. Twigs of bayberry and wild
beach plum made trees with which to border its avenues,
and every dear delight of swing and arbor and
garden pool beloved in Barbara's play-days, was reproduced
in miniature until Georgina loved them,
too. She knew just where the bee-hives ought to be
put, and the sun-dial, and the hole in the fence where
the little pigs squeezed through. There was a story
for everything. By the time she had outgrown her
lisp she could make the whole fair structure by herself,
without even a suggestion from Barbara.</p>

<p>When she grew older the shore was her schoolroom
also. She learned to read from letters traced
in the sand, and to make them herself with shells
and pebbles. She did her sums that way, too, after
she had learned to count the sails in the harbor, the
gulls feeding at ebb-tide, and the great granite blocks
which formed the break-water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett's time for lessons was when Georgina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was following her about the house. Such following
taught her to move briskly, for Tippy, like
time and tide, never waited, and it behooved one to
be close at her heels if one would see what she put
into a pan before she whisked it into the oven. Also
it was necessary to keep up with her as she moved
swiftly from the cellar to the pantry if one would
hear her thrilling tales of Indians and early settlers
and brave forefathers of colony times.</p>

<p>There was a powder horn hanging over the dining
room mantel, which had been in the battle of
Lexington, and Tippy expected Georgina to find the
same inspiration in it which she did, because the
forefather who carried it was an ancestor of each.</p>

<p>"The idea of a descendant of one of the Minute-men
being afraid of <i>rats!</i>" she would say with a
scornful rolling of her words which seemed to wither
her listener with ridicule. "Or of an empty garret!
<i>Tut!</i>"</p>

<p>When Georgina was no more than six, that disgusted
"Tut!" would start her instantly down a
dark cellar-way or up into the dreaded garret, even
when she could feel the goose-flesh rising all over
her. Between the porringer, which obliged her to
be a little lady, and the powder horn, which obliged
her to be brave, even while she shivered, some times
Georgina felt that she had almost too much to live
up to. There were times when she was sorry that
she had ancestors. She was proud to think that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of them shared in the honors of the tall Pilgrim
monument overlooking the town and harbor, but
there were days when she would have traded him
gladly <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'far'">for</ins> an hour's play with two little <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Portugese'">Portuguese</ins>
boys and their sister, who often wandered up to the
dunes back of the house.</p>

<p>She had watched them often enough to know that
their names were Manuel and Joseph and Rosa.
They were beautiful children, such as some of the
old masters delighted to paint, but they fought and
quarreled and&mdash;Tippy said&mdash;used "shocking language."
That is why Georgina was not allowed to
play with them, but she often stood at the back gate
watching them, envying their good times together
and hoping to hear a sample of their shocking language.</p>

<p>One day when they strolled by dragging a young
puppy in a rusty saucepan by a string tied to the
handle, the temptation to join them overcame her.
Inch by inch her hand moved up nearer the forbidden
gate latch and she was just slipping through when
old Jeremy, hidden behind a hedge where he was
weeding the borders, rose up like an all-seeing dragon
and roared at her, "Coom away, lass! Ye maun't
do that!"</p>

<p>She had not known that he was anywhere
around, and the voice coming suddenly out of the
unseen startled her so that her heart seemed to
jump up into her throat. It made her angry, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Only the moment before she had heard Rosa scream
at Manuel, "You ain't my boss; shut your big
mouth!"</p>

<p>It was on the tip of her tongue to scream the same
thing at old Jeremy and see what would happen. She
felt, instinctively, that this was shocking language.
But she had not yet outgrown the lurking fear which
always seized her in his presence that either her
teeth or his might fly out if she wasn't careful, so
she made no answer. But compelled to vent her inward
rebellion in some way, she turned her back on
the hedge that screened him and shook the gate till
the latch rattled.</p>

<p>Looking up she saw the tall Pilgrim monument
towering over the town like a watchful giant. She
had a feeling that it, too, was spying on her. No
matter where she went, even away out in the harbor
in a motor boat, it was always stretching its long
neck up to watch her. Shaking back her curls, she
looked up at it defiantly and made a face at it, just
the ugliest pucker of a face she could twist her little
features into.</p>

<p>But it was only on rare occasions that Georgina
felt the longing for playmates of her own age.
Usually she was busy with her lessons or happily
following her mother and Mrs. Triplett around the
house, sharing all their occupations. In jelly-making
time she had the scrapings of the kettle to fill her
own little glass. When they sewed she sewed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
them, even when she was so small that she had to
have the thread tied in the needle's eye, and could do
no more than pucker up a piece of soft goods into
big wallops. But by the time she was nine years old
she had learned to make such neat stitches that Barbara
sent specimens of her needlework back to Kentucky,
and folded others away in a little trunk of
keepsakes, to save for her until she should be grown.</p>

<p>Also by the time she was nine she could play quite
creditably a number of simple Etudes on the tinkly
old piano which had lost some of its ivories. Her
daily practicing was one of the few things about
which Barbara was strict. So much attention had
been given to her own education in music that she
found joy in keeping up her interest in it, and wanted
to make it one of Georgina's chief sources of pleasure.
To that end she mixed the stories of the great
operas and composers with her fairy tales and folk
lore, until the child knew them as intimately as she
did her Hans Andersen and Uncle Remus.</p>

<p>They often acted stories together, too. Even Mrs.
Triplett was dragged into these, albeit unwillingly,
for minor but necessary parts. For instance, in
"Lord Ullin's Daughter," she could keep on with her
knitting and at the same time do "the horsemen hard
behind us ride," by clapping her heels on the hearth
to sound like hoof-beats.</p>

<p>Acting came as naturally to Georgina as breathing.
She could not repeat the simplest message without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
unconsciously imitating the tone and gesture of the
one who sent it. This dramatic instinct made a
good reader of her when she took her turn with Barbara
in reading aloud. They used to take page
about, sitting with their arms around each other on
the old claw-foot sofa, backed up against the library
table.</p>

<p>At such performances the old Towncrier was
often an interested spectator. Barbara welcomed
him when he first came because he seemed to want to
talk about Justin as much as she desired to hear.
Later she welcomed him for his own sake, and grew
to depend upon him for counsel and encouragement.
Most of all she appreciated his affectionate interest
in Georgina. If he had been her own grandfather
he could not have taken greater pride in her little
accomplishments. More than once he had tied her
thread in her needle for her when she was learning
to sew, and it was his unfailing praise of her awkward
attempts which encouraged her to keep on until
her stitches were really praiseworthy.</p>

<p>He applauded her piano playing from her first
stumbling attempt at scales to the last simple waltz
she had just learned. He attended many readings,
beginning with words of one syllable, on up to such
books as "The Leatherstocking Tales." He came
in one day, however, as they were finishing a chapter
in one of the Judge's favorite novels, and no sooner
had Georgina skipped out of the room on an errand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
than he began to take her mother to task for allowing
her to read anything of that sort.</p>

<p>"You'll make the lass old before her time!" he
scolded. "A little scrap like her ought to be playing
with other children instead of reading books so far
over her head that she can only sort of tip-toe up to
them."</p>

<p>"But it's the stretching that makes her grow,
Uncle Darcy," Barbara answered in an indulgent
tone. He went on heedless of her interruption.</p>

<p>"And she tells me that she sometimes sits as much
as an hour at a time, listening to you play on the
piano, especially if it's 'sad music that makes you
think of someone looking off to sea for a ship that
never comes in, or of waves creeping up in a lonely
place where the fog-bell tolls.' Those were her very
words, and she looked so mournful that it worried
me. It isn't natural for a child of her age to sit with
a far-away look in her eyes, as if she were seeing
things that ain't there."</p>

<p>Barbara laughed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Uncle Darcy. As long as she keeps
her rosy cheeks and is full of life, a little dreaming
can't hurt her. You should have seen her doing the
elfin dance this morning. She entered into the spirit
of it like a little whirlwind. And, besides, there are
no children anywhere near that I can allow her to
play with. I have only a few acquaintances in the
town, and they are too far from us to make visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
easy between the children. But look at the time <i>I</i>
give to her. I play with her so much that we're more
like two chums than mother and child."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it would be better for both of you if you
had more friends outside. Then Georgina wouldn't
feel the sadness of 'someone looking off to sea for
a ship that never comes in.' She feels your separation
from Justin and your watching for his letters
and your making your whole life just a waiting time
between his furloughs, more than you have any idea
of."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Darcy!" exclaimed Barbara, "it
would be just the same no matter how many friends
I had. They couldn't make me forget his absence."</p>

<p>"No, but they could get you interested in other
things, and Georgina would feel the difference, and
be happier because you would not seem to be waiting
and anxious. There's some rare, good people in
this town, old friends of the family who tried to make
you feel at home among them when you first came."</p>

<p>"I know," admitted Barbara, slowly, "but I was
so young then, and so homesick that strangers didn't
interest me. Now Georgina is old enough to be
thoroughly companionable, and our music and sewing
and household duties fill our days."</p>

<p>It was a subject they had discussed before, without
either convincing the other, and the old man had
always gone away at such times with a feeling of
defeat. But this time as he took his leave, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with the determination to take the matter in hand
himself. He felt he owed it to the Judge to do that
much for his grandchild. The usual crowds of summer
people would be coming soon. He had heard
that Gray Inn was to be re-opened this summer.
That meant there would probably be children at this
end of the beach. If Opportunity came that near
to Georgina's door he knew several ways of inducing
it to knock. So he went off smiling to himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NEW FRIENDS AND THE GREEN STAIRS</div>


<div class='cap'>THE town filled up with artists earlier than usual
that summer. Stable lofts and old boathouses
along the shore blossomed into studios. Sketching
classes met in the rooms of the big summer art
schools which made the Cape end famous, or set up
their models down by the wharfs. One ran into
easels pitched in the most public places: on busy street
corners, on the steps of the souvenir shops and even
in front of the town hall. People in paint-besmeared
smocks, loaded with canvases, sketching stools and
palettes, filled the board-walk and overflowed into
the middle of the street.</div>

<p>The <i>Dorothy Bradford</i> steamed up to the wharf
from Boston with her daily load of excursionists, and
the "accommodation" busses began to ply up and
down the three miles of narrow street with its restless
tide of summer visitors.</p>

<p>Up along, through the thick of it one June morning,
came the Towncrier, a picturesque figure in his
short blue jacket and wide seaman's trousers, a red
bandanna knotted around his throat and a wide-rimmed
straw hat on the back of his head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Notice!" he cried, after each vigorous ringing
of his big brass bell. "Lost, between Mayflower
Heights and the Gray Inn, a black leather bill-case
with important papers."</p>

<p>He made slow progress, for someone stopped him
at almost every rod with a word of greeting, and
he stopped to pat every dog which thrust a friendly
nose into his hand in passing. Several times strangers
stepped up to him to inquire into his affairs as if he
were some ancient historical personage come to life.
Once he heard a man say:</p>

<p>"Quick with your kodak, Ethel. Catch the Towncrier
as he comes along. They say there's only one
other place in the whole United States that has one.
You can't afford to miss anything <i>this</i> quaint."</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when he came towards the end
of the beach. He walked still more slowly here,
for many cottages had been opened for summer residents
since the last time he passed along, and he
knew some of the owners. He noticed that the loft
above a boat-house which had once been the studio
of a famous painter of marine scenes was again in
use. He wondered who had taken it. Almost across
from it was the "Green Stairs" where Georgina always
came to meet him if she were outdoors and
heard his bell.</p>

<p>The "Green Stairs" was the name she had given to
a long flight of wooden steps with a railing on each
side, leading from the sidewalk up a steep embankment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to the bungalow on top. It was a wide-spreading
bungalow with as many windows looking out to
sea as a lighthouse, and had had an especial interest
for Georgina, since she heard someone say that its
owner, Mr. Milford, was an old bachelor who lived
by himself. She used to wonder when she was
younger if "all the bread and cheese he got he kept
upon a shelf." Once she asked Barbara why he
didn't "go to London to get him a wife," and was
told probably because he had so many guests that
there wasn't time. Interesting people were always
coming and going about the house; men famous for
things they had done or written or painted.</p>

<p>Now as the Towncrier came nearer, he saw
Georgina skipping along toward him with her jumping
rope. She was bare-headed, her pink dress fluttering
in the salt breeze, her curls blowing back from
her glowing little face. He would have hastened his
steps to meet her, but his honest soul always demanded
a certain amount of service from himself for
the dollar paid him for each trip of this kind. So
he went on at his customary gait, stopping at the
usual intervals to ring his bell and call his news.</p>

<p>At the Green Stairs Georgina paused, her attention
attracted by a foreign-looking battleship just
steaming into the harbor. She was familiar with
nearly every kind of sea-going craft that ever anchored
here, but she could not classify this one. With
her hands behind her, clasping her jumping rope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
ready for another throw, she stood looking out to
sea. Presently a slight scratching sound behind her
made her turn suddenly. Then she drew back
startled, for she was face to face with a dog which
was sitting on the step just on a level with her eyes.
He was a ragged-looking tramp of a dog, an Irish
terrier, but he looked at her in such a knowing,
human way that she spoke to him as if he had been
a person.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, how you made me jump! I
didn't know anybody was sitting there behind me."</p>

<p>It was almost uncanny the way his eyes twinkled
through his hair, as if he were laughing with her
over some good joke they had together. It gave her
such a feeling of comradeship that she stood and
smiled back at him. Suddenly he raised his right
paw and thrust it towards her. She drew back another
step. She was not used to dogs, and she hesitated
about touching anything with such claws in it
as the paw he gravely presented.</p>

<p>But as he continued to hold it out she felt it
would be impolite not to respond in some way, so
reaching out very cautiously she gave it a limp shake.
Then as he still kept looking at her with questioning
eyes she asked quite as if she expected him to speak,
"What's your name, Dog?"</p>

<p>A voice from the top of the steps answered, "It's
Captain Kidd." Even more startled than when the
dog had claimed her attention, she glanced up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
see a small boy on the highest step. He was sucking
an orange, but he took his mouth away from it long
enough to add, "His name's on his collar that he got
yesterday, and so's mine. You can look at 'em if you
want to."</p>

<p>Georgina leaned forward to peer at the engraving
on the front of the collar, but the hair on the shaggy
throat hid it, and she was timid about touching a
spot just below such a wide open mouth with a red
tongue lolling out of it. She put her hands behind
her instead.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is he&mdash;a pirate dog?" she ventured.</p>

<p>The boy considered a minute, not wanting to say
yes if pirates were not respectable in her eyes, and
not wanting to lose the chance of glorifying him if
she held them in as high esteem as he did. After a
long meditative suck at his orange he announced,
"Well, he's just as good as one. He buries all his
treasures. That's why we call him Captain Kidd."</p>

<p>Georgina shot a long, appraising glance at the
boy from under her dark lashes. His eyes were
dark, too. There was something about him that attracted
her, even if his face was smeary with orange
juice and streaked with dirty finger marks. She
wanted to ask more about Captain Kidd, but her
acquaintance with boys was as slight as with dogs.
Overcome by a sudden shyness she threw her rope
over her head and went skipping on down the boardwalk
to meet the Towncrier.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy stood up and looked after her. He
wished she hadn't been in such a hurry. It had been
the longest morning he ever lived through. Having
arrived only the day before with his father to
visit at the bungalow he hadn't yet discovered what
there was for a boy to do in this strange place.
Everybody had gone off and left him with the servants,
and told him to play around till they got back.
It wouldn't be long, they said, but he had waited and
waited until he felt he had been looking out to sea
from the top of those green steps all the days of his
life. Of course, he wouldn't want to play with just
a girl, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He watched the pink dress go fluttering on, and
then he saw Georgina take the bell away from the
old man as if it were her right to do so. She turned
and walked along beside him, tinkling it faintly as
she talked. He wished <i>he</i> had a chance at it. He'd
show her how loud he could make it sound.</p>

<p>"Notice," called the old man, seeing faces appear
at some of the windows they were passing. "Lost,
a black leather bill-case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boy, listening curiously, slid down the steps
until he reached the one on which the dog was sitting,
and put his arm around its neck. The banister posts
hid him from the approaching couple. He could
hear Georgina's eager voice piping up flute-like:</p>

<p>"It's a pirate dog, Uncle Darcy. He's named
Captain Kidd because he buries his treasures."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>In answer the old man's quavering voice rose in
a song which he had roared lustily many a time in
his younger days, aboard many a gallant vessel:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Oh, my name is Captain Kidd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And many wick-ud things I did,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And heaps of gold I hid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">As I sailed."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>The way his voice slid down on the word wick-<i>ud</i>
made a queer thrilly feeling run down the boy's back,
and all of a sudden the day grew wonderfully interesting,
and this old seaport town one of the nicest
places he had ever been in. The singer stopped at
the steps and Georgina, disconcerted at finding the
boy at such close range when she expected to see him
far above her, got no further in her introduction to
Captain Kidd than "Here he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the old man needed no introduction. He had
only to speak to the dog to set every inch of him
quivering in affectionate response. "Here's a friend
worth having," the raggedy tail seemed to signal in
a wig-wag code of its own.</p>

<p>Then the wrinkled hand went from the dog's head
to the boy's shoulder with the same kind of an affectionate
pat. "What's <i>your</i> name, son?"</p>

<p>"Richard Morland."</p>

<p>"What?" was the surprised question. "Are you
a son of the artist Morland, who is visiting up here
at the Milford bungalow?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, that's us."</p>

<p>"Well, bless my stars, it's <i>his</i> bill-case I have been
crying all morning. If I'd known there was a fine
lad like you sitting about doing nothing, I'd had you
with me, ringing the bell."</p>

<p>The little fellow's face glowed. He was as quick
to recognize a friend worth having as Captain Kidd
had been.</p>

<p>"Say," he began, "if it was Daddy's bill-case you
were shouting about, you needn't do it any longer.
It's found. Captain Kidd came in with it in his
mouth just after Daddy went away. He was starting
to dig a hole in the sand down by the garage to
bury it in, like he does everything. He's hardly done
being a puppy yet, you know. I took it away from
him and reckanized it, and I've been waiting here
all morning for Dad to come home."</p>

<p>He began tugging at the pocket into which he had
stowed the bill-case for safe-keeping, and Captain
Kidd, feeling that it was his by right of discovery,
stood up, wagging himself all over, and poking his
nose in between them, with an air of excited interest.
The Towncrier shook his finger at him.</p>

<p>"You rascal! I suppose you'll be claiming the reward
next thing, you old pirate! How old is he,
Richard?"</p>

<p>"About a year. He was given to me when he was
just a little puppy."</p>

<p>"And how old are you, son?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ten my last birthday, but I'm so big for my age
I wear 'leven-year-old suits."</p>

<p>Now the Towncrier hadn't intended to stop, but
the dog began burrowing its head ecstatically against
him, and there was something in the boy's lonesome,
dirty little face which appealed to him, and the next
thing he knew he was sitting on the bottom step of
the Green Stairs with Georgina beside him, telling
the most thrilling pirate story he knew. And he told
it more thrillingly than he had ever told it before.
The reason for this was he had never had such a
spellbound listener before. Not even Justin had
hung on each word with the rapt interest this boy
showed. His dark eyes seemed to grow bigger and
more luminous with each sentence, more intense in
their piercing gaze. His sensitive mouth changed
expression with every phase of the adventure&mdash;danger,
suspense, triumph. He scarcely breathed, he
was listening so hard.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whistle at the cold-storage plant
began to blow for noon, and the old man rose stiffly,
saying:</p>

<p>"I'm a long way from home, I should have started
back sooner."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you haven't finished the story!" cried the
boy, in distress at this sudden ending. "It <i>couldn't</i>
stop there."</p>

<p>Georgina caught him by the sleeve of the old blue
jacket to pull him back to the seat beside her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Please</i>, Uncle Darcy!"</p>

<p>It was the first time in all her coaxing that that
magic word failed to bend him to her wishes.</p>

<p>"No," he answered firmly, "I can't finish it now,
but I'll tell you what I'll do. This afternoon I'll row
up to this end of the beach in my dory and take you
two children out to the weirs to see the net hauled
in. There's apt to be a big catch of squid worth
going to see, and I'll finish the story on the way.
Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>Richard stood up, as eager and excited as Captain
Kidd always was when anybody said "Rats!"
But the next instant the light died out of his eyes and
he plumped himself gloomily down on the step, as
if life were no longer worth living.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" he exclaimed. "I forgot. I can't
go anywhere. Dad's painting my portrait, and I
have to stick around so's he can work on it any old
time he feels like it. That's why he brought me on
this visit with him, so's he can finish it up here."</p>

<p>"Maybe you can beg off, just for to-day," suggested
Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p>"No, it's very important," he explained gravely.
"It's the best one Daddy's done yet, and the last
thing before we left home Aunt Letty said, 'Whatever
you do, boys, don't let anything interfere with
getting that picture done in time to hang in the exhibition,'
and we both promised."</p>

<p>There was gloomy silence for a moment, broken
by the old man's cheerful voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, don't you worry till you see what we can do.
I want to see your father anyhow about this bill-case
business, so I'll come around this afternoon, and if
he doesn't let you off to-day maybe he will to-morrow.
Just trust your Uncle Darcy for getting where he
starts out to go. Skip along home, Georgina, and
tell your mother I want to borrow you for the afternoon."</p>

<p>An excited little pink whirlwind with a jumping
rope going over and over its head, went flying up
the street toward the end of the beach. A smiling
old man with age looking out of his faded blue eyes
but with the spirit of boyhood undimmed in his
heart, walked slowly down towards the town. And
on the bottom step of the Green Stairs, his arm
around Captain Kidd, the boy sat watching them,
looking from one to the other as long as they were
in sight. The heart of him was pounding deliciously
to the music of such phrases as, "<i>Fathoms deep,
lonely beach, spade and pickaxe, skull and cross-bones,
bags of golden doubloons and chests of ducats
and pearls!</i>"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF PIRATES</div>


<div class='cap'>THE weirs, to which they took their way that
afternoon in the Towncrier's dory, <i>The Betsey</i>,
was "the biggest fish-trap in any waters thereabouts,"
the old man told them. And it happened that the
net held an unusually large catch that day. Barrels
and barrels of flapping squid and mackerel were
emptied into the big motor boat anchored alongside
of it.</div>

<p>At a word from Uncle Darcy, an obliging fisherman
in oilskins held out his hand to help the children
scramble over the side of <i>The Betsey</i> to a seat
on top of the cabin where they could have a better
view. All the crew were Portuguese. The man who
helped them climb over was Joe Fayal, father of
Manuel and Joseph and Rosa. He stood like a
young brown Neptune, his white teeth flashing when
he laughed, a pitchfork in his hands with which
to spear the goosefish as they turned up in the net,
and throw them back into the sea. If nothing else
had happened that sight alone was enough to mark
it as a memorable afternoon.</p>

<p>Nothing else did happen, really, except that on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the way out, Uncle Darcy finished the story begun
on the Green Stairs and on the way back told them
another. But what Richard remembered ever after
as seeming to have happened, was that <i>The Betsey</i>
suddenly turned into a Brigantine. Perched up on
one of the masts, an unseen spectator, he watched a
mutiny flare up among the sailors, and saw that
"strutting, swaggering villain, John Quelch, throw
the captain overboard and take command himself."
He saw them hoist a flag they called "Old Roger,"
"having in the middle of it an Anatomy (skeleton)
with an hour-glass in one hand and a dart in the
heart with three drops of blood proceeding from
it."</p>

<p>He heard the roar that went up from all those
bearded throats&mdash;(wonderful how Uncle Darcy's
thin, quavering voice could sound that whole
chorus)&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Of all the lives, I ever say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A Pirate's be for I.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hap what hap may, he's allus gay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An' drinks an' bungs his eye.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For his work he's never loth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An' a-pleasurin' he'll go</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tho' certain sure to be popt off.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yo ho, with the rum below."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>And then they made after the Portuguese vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
nine of them, and took them all (What a bloody fight
it was!), and sailed away with a dazzling store of
treasure, "enough to make an honest sailorman rub
his eyes and stagger in his tracks."</p>

<p>Richard had not been brought up on stories as
Georgina had. He had had few of this kind, and
none so breathlessly realistic. It carried him out
of himself so completely that as they rowed slowly
back to town he did not see a single house in it, although
every western window-pane flashed back the
out-going sun like a golden mirror. His serious,
brown eyes were following the adventures of these
bold sea-robbers, "marooned three times and
wounded nine and blowed up in the air."</p>

<p>When all of a sudden the brigantine changed back
into <i>The Betsey</i>, and he had to climb out at the boat-landing,
he had somewhat of the dazed feeling of
that honest sailor-man. He had heard enough to
make him "rub his eyes and stagger in his tracks."</p>

<p>Uncle Darcy, having put them ashore, rowed off
with the parting injunction to skip along home.
Georgina did skip, so light of foot and quick of
movement that she was in the lead all the way to the
Green Stairs. There she paused and waited for
Richard to join her. As he came up he spoke for
the first time since leaving the weirs.</p>

<p>"Wish I knew the boys in this town. Wish I
knew which one would be the best to get to go digging
with me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Georgina did not need to ask, "digging for what?"
She, too, had been thinking of buried treasure.</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> go with you," she volunteered sweetly.</p>

<p>He turned on her an inquiring look, as if he were
taking her measure, then glanced away indifferently.</p>

<p>"You couldn't. You're a girl."</p>

<p>It was a matter-of-fact statement with no suspicion
of a taunt in it, but it stung Georgina's pride.
Her eyes blazed defiantly and she tossed back her
curls with a proud little uplift of the chin. It must
be acknowledged that her nose, too, took on the
trifle of a tilt. Her challenge was unspoken but so
evident that he answered it.</p>

<p>"Well, you know you couldn't creep out into the
night and go along a lonely shore into dark caves
and everything."</p>

<p>"<i>Pity</i> I couldn't!" she answered with withering
scorn. "I could go anywhere <i>you</i> could, anybody
descended from heroes like <i>I</i> am. I don't want to be
braggity, but I'd have you to know they put up that
big monument over there for one of them, and another
was a Minute-man. With all that, for you
to think I'd be afraid! <i>Tut!</i>"</p>

<p>Not Tippy herself had ever spoken that word
with finer scorn. With a flirt of her short skirts
Georgina turned and started disdainfully up the
street.</p>

<p>"Wait," called Richard. He liked the sudden
flare-up of her manner. There was something convincing
about it. Besides, he didn't want her to go
off in that independent way as if she meant never to
come back. It was she who had brought the Towncrier,
that matchless Teller of Tales, across his path.</p>

<p>"I didn't say you wasn't brave," he called after
her.</p>

<p>She hesitated, then stopped, turning half-way
around.</p>

<p>"I just said you was a girl. Most of them <i>are</i>
'fraid cats, but if you ain't I don't know as I'd mind
taking you along. That is," he added cautiously, "if
I could be dead sure that you're game."</p>

<p>At that Georgina turned all the way around and
came back a few steps.</p>

<p>"You can try me," she answered, anxious to prove
herself worthy to be taken on such a quest, and as
eager as he to begin it.</p>

<p>"You think of the thing you're most afraid of
yourself, and tell me to do it, and then just watch
me."</p>

<p>Richard declined to admit any fear of anything.
Georgina named several terrors at which he stoutly
shook his head, but presently with uncanny insight
she touched upon his weakest point.</p>

<p>"Would you be afraid of coffins and spooks or to
go to a graveyard in the dead of the night the way
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn did?"</p>

<p>Not having read Tom Sawyer, Richard evaded the
question by asking, "How did they do?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know? They had the dead cat
and they saw old Injun Joe come with the lantern and
kill the man that was with Muff Potter."</p>

<p>By the time Georgina had given the bare outline of
the story in her dramatic way, Richard was quite sure
that no power under heaven could entice him into a
graveyard at midnight, though nothing could have
induced him to admit this to Georgina. As far back
as he could remember he had had an unreasoning
dread of coffins. Even now, big as he was, big
enough to wear "'leven-year-old suits," nothing
could tempt him into a furniture shop for fear of
seeing a coffin.</p>

<p>One of his earliest recollections was of his nurse
taking him into a little shop, at some village where
they were spending the summer, and his cold terror
when he found himself directly beside a long brown
one, smelling of varnish, and with silver handles.
His nurse's tales had much to do with creating this
repulsion, also her threat of shutting him up in a
coffin if he wasn't a good boy. When she found
that she could exact obedience by keeping that dread
hanging over him, she used the threat daily.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," he said finally. "I'll
let you go digging with me if you're game enough to
go to the graveyard and walk clear across it all by
yourself and"&mdash;dropping his voice to a hollow whisper&mdash;"<i>touch&mdash;ten&mdash;tombstones!</i>"</p>

<p>Now, if Richard hadn't dropped his voice in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
scary way when he said, "and touch ten tombstones,"
it would have been no test at all of Georgina's courage.
Strange, how just his way of saying those four
words suddenly made the act such a fearsome one.</p>

<p>"Do it right now," he suggested.</p>

<p>"But it isn't night yet," she answered, "let alone
being mid-night."</p>

<p>"No, but it's clouding up, and the sun's down. By
the time we'd get to a graveyard it would be dark
enough for me to tell if you're game."</p>

<p>Up to this time Georgina had never gone anywhere
without permission. But this was something
one couldn't explain very well at home. It seemed
better to do it first and explain afterward.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, two children and a dog
arrived hot and panting at the entrance to the old
burying ground. On a high sand dune, covered with
thin patches of beach and poverty grass, and a sparse
growth of scraggly pines, it was a desolate spot at
any time, and now doubly so in the gathering twilight.
The lichen-covered slabs that marked the
graves of the early settlers leaned this way and that
along the hill.</p>

<p>The gate was locked, but Georgina found a place
where the palings were loose, and squeezed through,
leaving Richard and the dog outside. They watched
her through the fence as she toiled up the steep hill.
The sand was so deep that she plunged in over her
shoe-tops at every step. Once on top it was easier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
going. The matted beach grass made a firm turf.
She stopped and read the names on some of the
slabs before she plucked up courage to touch one.
She would not have hesitated an instant if only
Richard had not dared her in that scary way.</p>

<p>Some little, wild creature started up out of the
grass ahead of her and scurried away. Her heart
beat so fast she could hear the blood pounding
against her ear-drums. She looked back. Richard
was watching, and she was to wave her hand each
time she touched a stone so that he could keep count
with her. She stooped and peered at one, trying to
read the inscription. The clouds had hurried the
coming of twilight. It was hard to decipher the
words.</p>

<p>"None knew him but to love him," she read slowly.
Instantly her dread of the place vanished. She laid
her hand on the stone and then waved to Richard.
Then she ran on and read and touched another.
"Lost at sea," that one said, and under the next slabs
slept "Deliverance" and "Experience," "Mercy,"
and "Thankful." What queer names people had in
those early days! And what strange pictures they
etched in the stone of those old gray slabs&mdash;urns and
angels and weeping willows!</p>

<p>She signaled the tenth and last. Richard wondered
why she did not turn and come back. At the
highest point of the hill she stood as if transfixed, a
slim little silhouette against the darkening sky, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
hands clasped in amazement. Suddenly she turned
and came tearing down the hill, floundering through
sand, falling and picking herself up, only to flounder
and fall again, finally rolling down the last few yards
of the embankment.</p>

<p>"What scared you?" asked Richard, his eyes big
with excitement as he watched what seemed to be
her terrified exit. "What did you see?" But she
would not speak until she had squeezed between the
palings and stood beside him. Then she told him
in an impressive whisper, glancing furtively over her
shoulder:</p>

<p>"There's a whole row of tombstones up there
with <i>skulls and cross-bones on them! They must
be pirate graves!</i>"</p>

<p>Her mysterious air was so contagious that he answered
in a whisper, and in a moment each was
convinced by the other's mere manner that their suspicion
was true. Presently Georgina spoke in her
natural voice.</p>

<p>"You go up and look at them."</p>

<p>"Naw, I'll take your word for it," he answered
in a patronizing tone. "Besides, there isn't time
now. It's getting too dark. They'll be expecting me
home to supper."</p>

<p>Georgina glanced about her. The clouds settling
heavily made it seem later than it really was. She
had a guilty feeling that Barby was worrying about
her long absence, maybe imagining that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
had happened to <i>The Betsey</i>. She started homeward,
half running, but her pace slackened as Richard,
hurrying along beside her, began to plan what
they would do with their treasure when they found
it.</p>

<p>"There's sure to be piles of buried gold around
here," he said. "Those pirate graves prove that a
lot of 'em lived here once. Let's buy a moving picture
show first."</p>

<p>Georgina's face grew radiant at this tacit admission
of herself into partnership.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she assented joyfully. "And then we
can have moving pictures made of <i>us</i> doing all sorts
of things. Won't it be fun to sit back and watch
ourselves and see how we look doing 'em?"</p>

<p>"Say! that's great," he exclaimed. "All the kids
in town will want to be in the pictures, too, but we'll
have the say-so, and only those who do exactly to suit
us can have a chance of getting in."</p>

<p>"But the more we let in the more money we'd
make in the show," was Georgina's shrewd answer.
"Everybody will want to see what their child looks
like in the movies, so, of course, that'll make people
come to our show instead of the other ones."</p>

<p>"Say," was the admiring reply. "You're a partner
worth having. You've got a <i>head</i>."</p>

<p>Such praise was the sweetest incense to Georgina.
She burned to call forth more.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I can think of lots of things when once I
get started," she assured him with a grand air.</p>

<p>As they ran along Richard glanced several times
at the head from which had come such valuable suggestions.
There was a gleam of gold in the brown
curls which bobbed over her shoulders. He liked
it. He hadn't noticed before that her hair was
pretty.</p>

<p>There was a gleam of gold, also, in the thoughts
of each. They could fairly see the nuggets they
were soon to unearth, and their imaginations, each
fired by the other, shoveled out the coin which the
picture show was to yield them, in the same way that
the fisherman had shoveled the shining mackerel into
the boat. They had not attempted to count them,
simply measured them by the barrelful.</p>

<p>"Don't tell anybody," Richard counseled her as
they parted at the Green Stairs. "Cross your heart
and body you won't tell a soul. We want to surprise
'em."</p>

<p>Georgina gave the required sign and promise, as
gravely as if it were an oath.</p>

<p>From the front porch Richard's father and cousin,
James Milford, watched him climb slowly up the
Green Stairs.</p>

<p>"Dicky looks as if the affairs of the nation were
on his shoulders," observed Cousin James. "Pity he
doesn't realize these are his care-free days."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're not," answered the elder Richard.
"They're the most deadly serious ones he'll ever
have. I don't know what he's got on his mind now,
but whatever it is I'll wager it is more important
business than that deal you're trying to pull off with
the Cold Storage people."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SPEND-THE-DAY GUESTS</div>


<div class='cap'>THERE was a storm that night and next day a
heavy fog dropped down like a thick white veil
over town and sea. It was so cold that Jeremy
lighted a fire, not only in the living room but in the
guest chamber across the hall.</div>

<p>A week earlier Tippy had announced, "It'll never
do to let Cousin Mehitable Huntingdon go back to
Hyannis without having broken bread with us. She'd
talk about it to the end of her days, if we were the
only relations in town who failed to ask her in to a
meal, during her fortnight's visit. And, of course,
if we ask her, all the family she's staying with ought
to be invited, and we've never had the new minister
and his wife here to eat. Might as well do it all up
at once while we're about it."</p>

<p>Spend-the-day guests were rare in Georgina's experience.
The grand preparations for their entertainment
which went on that morning put the new
partnership and the treasure-quest far into the background.
She forgot it entirely while the dining-room
table, stretched to its limit, was being set with the
best china and silver as if for a Thanksgiving feast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Mrs. Fayal, the mother of Manuel and Joseph and
Rosa, came over to help in the kitchen, and Tippy
whisked around so fast that Georgina, tagging after,
was continually meeting her coming back.</p>

<p>Georgina was following to ask questions about the
expected guests. She liked the gruesome sound of
that term "blood relations" as Tippy used it, and
wanted to know all about this recently discovered
"in-law," the widow of her grandfather's cousin,
Thomas Huntingdon. Barby could not tell her and
Mrs. Triplett, too busy to be bothered, set her down
to turn the leaves of the family album. But the
photograph of Cousin Mehitable had been taken
when she was a boarding-school miss in a disfiguring
hat and basque, and bore little resemblance to the
imposing personage who headed the procession of
visitors, arriving promptly at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>When Cousin Mehitable came into the room in her
widow's bonnet with the long black veil hanging
down behind, she seemed to fill the place as the
massive black walnut wardrobe upstairs filled the alcove.
She lifted her eyeglasses from the hook on her
dress to her hooked nose to look at Georgina before
she kissed her. Under that gaze the child felt as
awed as if the big wardrobe had bent over and put
a wooden kiss on her forehead and said in a deep,
whispery sort of voice, "So this is the Judge's granddaughter.
How do you do, my dear?"</p>

<p>All the guests were middle aged and most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
portly. There were so many that they filled all the
chairs and the long claw-foot sofa besides. Georgina
sat on a foot-stool, her hands folded in her lap
until the others took out their knitting and embroidery.
Then she ran to get the napkin she was hemming.
The husbands who had been invited did not
arrive until time to sit down to dinner and they left
immediately after the feast.</p>

<p>Georgina wished that everybody would keep still
and let one guest at a time do the talking. After the
first few minutes of general conversation the circle
broke into little groups, and it wasn't possible to follow
the thread of the story in more than one. Each
group kept bringing to light some bit of family history
that she wanted to hear or some old family joke
which they laughed over as if it were the funniest
thing that ever happened. It was tantalizing not to
be able to hear them all. It made her think of times
when she rummaged through the chests in the attic,
pulling out fascinating old garments and holding
them up for Tippy to supply their history. But this
was as bad as opening all the chests at once. While
she was busy with one she was missing all that was
being hauled out to the light of day from the others.</p>

<p>Several times she moved her foot-stool from one
group to another, drawn by some sentence such as,
"Well, she certainly was the prettiest bride I ever
laid my two eyes on, but not many of us would want
to stand in her shoes now." Or from across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
room, "They do say it was what happened the night
of the wreck that unbalanced his mind, but I've always
thought it was having things go at sixes and
sevens at home as they did."</p>

<p>Georgina would have settled herself permanently
near Cousin Mehitable, she being the most dramatic
and voluble of them all, but she had a tantalizing
way of lowering her voice at the most interesting
part, and whispering the last sentence behind her
hand. Georgina was nearly consumed with curiosity
each time that happened, and fairly ached to know
these whispered revelations.</p>

<p>It was an entrancing day&mdash;the dinner so good, the
ancient jokes passing around the table all so new and
witty to Georgina, hearing them now for the first
time. She wished that a storm would come up to keep
everybody at the house overnight and thus prolong
the festal feeling. She liked this "Company" atmosphere
in which everyone seemed to grow expansive
of soul and gracious of speech. She loved every
relative she had to the remotest "in-law."</p>

<p>Her heart swelled with a great thankfulness to
think that she was not an orphan. Had she been one
there would have been no one to remark that her eyes
were exactly like Justin's and she carried herself like
a Huntingdon, but that she must have inherited her
smile from the other side of the house. Barbara had
that same smile and winning way with her. It was
pleasant to be discussed when only pleasant things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were said, and to have her neat stitches exclaimed
over and praised as they were passed around.</p>

<p>She thought about it again after dinner, and felt so
sorry for children who were orphans, that she decided
to spend a large part of her share of the buried
treasure in making them happy. She was sure that
Richard would give part of his share, too, when he
found it, and when the picture show which they were
going to buy was in good running order, they would
make it a rule that orphans should always be let in
free.</p>

<p>She came back from this pleasant day-dream to
hear Cousin Mehitable saying, "Speaking of thieves,
does anyone know what ever became of poor Dan
Darcy?"</p>

<p>Nobody knew, and they all shook their heads and
said that it was a pity that he had turned out so
badly. It was hard to believe it of him when he
had always been such a kind, pleasant-spoken boy,
just like his father; and if ever there was an honest
soul in the whole round world it was the old Towncrier.</p>

<p>At that Georgina gave such a start that she ran
her needle into her thumb, and a tiny drop of blood
spurted out. She did not know that Uncle Darcy
had a son. She had never heard his name mentioned
before. She had been at his house many a time, and
there never was anyone there besides himself except
his wife, "Aunt Elspeth" (who was so old and feeble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that she stayed in bed most of the time), and the
three cats, "John Darcy and Mary Darcy and old
Yellownose." That's the way the old man always
spoke of them. He called them his family.</p>

<p>Georgina was glad that the minister's wife was a
newcomer in the town and asked to have it explained.
Everybody contributed a scrap of the story, for all
side conversations stopped at the mention of Dan
Darcy's name, and the interest of the whole room
centered on him.</p>

<p>It was years ago, when he was not more than
eighteen that it happened. He was a happy-go-lucky
sort of fellow who couldn't be kept down to steady
work such as a job in the bank or a store. He was
always off a-fishing or on the water, but everybody
liked him and said he'd settle down when he was a
bit older. He had a friend much like himself, only
a little older. Emmett Potter was his name. There
was a regular David and Jonathan friendship between
those two. They were hand-in-glove in everything
till Dan went wrong. Both even liked the same
girl, Belle Triplett.</p>

<p>Here Georgina's needle gave her another jab. She
laid down her hemming to listen. This was bringing
the story close home, for Belle Triplett was Tippy's
niece, or rather her husband's niece. While that did
not make Belle one of the Huntingdon family, Georgina
had always looked upon her as such. She visited
at the house oftener than anyone else.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody in the room came right out and said what
it was that Dan had done, but by putting the scraps
together Georgina discovered presently that the
trouble was about some stolen money. Lots of people
wouldn't believe that he was guilty at first, but
so many things pointed his way that finally they had
to. The case was about to be brought to trial when
one night Dan suddenly disappeared as if the sea had
swallowed him, and nothing had ever been heard
from him since. Judge Huntingdon said it was a
pity, for even if he was guilty he thought he could
have got him off, there being nothing but circumstantial
evidence.</p>

<p>Well, it nearly killed his father and mother and
Emmett Potter, too.</p>

<p>It came out then that Emmett was engaged to
Belle. For nearly a year he grieved about Dan's
disappearance. Seems he took it to heart so that
he couldn't bear to do any of the things they'd always
done together or go to the old places. Belle
had her wedding dress made and thought if she could
once get him down to Truro to live, he'd brace up
and get over it.</p>

<p>They had settled on the day, when one wild,
stormy night word came that a vessel was pounding
itself to pieces off Peaked Hill Bar, and the life-saving
crew was starting to the rescue. Emmett lit
out to see it, and when something happened to the
breeches buoy so they couldn't use it, he was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to answer when the call came for volunteers to man
a boat to put out to them. He would have had a
medal if he'd lived to wear it, for he saved five lives
that night. But he lost his own the last time he
climbed up on the vessel. Nobody knew whether it
was a rope gave way or whether his fingers were so
nearly frozen he couldn't hold on, but he dropped
into that raging sea, and his body was washed up
on the beach next day.</p>

<p>Georgina listened, horrified.</p>

<p>"And Belle with her wedding dress all ready,"
said Cousin Mehitable with a husky sigh.</p>

<p>"What became of her?" asked the minister's wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's still living here in town, but it blighted
her whole life in a way, although she was just in her
teens when it happened. It helped her to bear up,
knowing he'd died such a hero. Some of the town
people put up a tombstone to his memory, with a
beautiful inscription on it that the summer people
go to see, almost as much as the landing place of the
Pilgrims. She'll be true to his memory always, and
it's something beautiful to see her devotion to Emmett's
father. She calls him "Father" Potter, and
is always doing things for him. He's that old net-mender
who lives alone out on the edge of town
near the cranberry bogs."</p>

<p>Cousin Mehitable took up the tale:</p>

<p>"I'll never forget if I live to be a hundred, what
I saw on my way home the night after Emmett was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
drowned. I was living here then, you know. I was
passing through Fishburn Court, and I thought I'd
go in and speak a word to Mr. Darcy, knowing how
fond he'd always been of Emmett on account of Dan
and him being such friends. I went across that sandy
place they call the Court, to the row of cottages at
the end. But I didn't see anything until I had opened
the Darcy's gate and stepped into the yard. The
house sits sideways to the Court, you know.</p>

<p>"The yellow blind was pulled down over the front
window, but the lamp threw a shadow on it, plain as
a photograph. It was the shadow of the old man,
sitting there with his arms flung out across the table,
and his head bowed down on them. I was just hesitating,
whether to knock or to slip away, when I
heard him groan, and sort of cry out, "Oh, my
Danny! My Danny! If only you could have gone
<i>that</i> way.""</p>

<p>Barbara, hearing a muffled sob behind her, turned
to see the tears running down Georgina's face. The
next instant she was up, and with her arms around
the child, was gently pushing her ahead of her out
of the room, into the hall. With the door shut
behind her she said soothingly:</p>

<p>"Barby didn't know they were going to tell such
unhappy stories, darling. I shouldn't have let you
stay."</p>

<p>"But I <i>want</i> to know," sobbed Georgina. "When
people you love have trouble you ought to know, so's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to be kinder to them. Oh, Barby, I'm so sorry I
ever was saucy to him. And I wish I hadn't teased
his cats. I tied paper bags on all of John Darcy
and Mary Darcy's paws, and he said I made old
Y-yellownose n-nervous, tickling his ears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Barbara stopped the sobbing confessions with a
kiss and took Georgina's jacket from the hat-rack.</p>

<p>"Here," she said. "It's bad for you to sit in the
house all day and listen to grown people talk. Slip
into this and run outdoors with your skipping rope
a while. Uncle Darcy has had very great trouble,
but he's learned to bear it like a hero, and nothing
would make him grieve more than to know that any
shadow of his sorrow was making you unhappy. The
way for you to help him most is to be as bright and
jolly as you can, and to <i>tease</i> his old cats once in a
while."</p>

<p>Georgina looked up through her tears, her dimples
all showing, and threw her arms around her adoringly.</p>

<p>"What a funny mother you are, Barby. Not a bit
like the ones in books."</p>

<p>A cold wind was blowing the fog away. She raced
up and down the beach for a long time, and when
she came back it was with red cheeks and ruffled
curls. Having left the company in tears she did
not like to venture back for fear of the remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
which might be made. So she crossed the hall and
stood in the door of the guest chamber, considering
what to do next. Its usual chill repellance had been
changed into something inviting by the wood fire on
the hearth, and on the bed where the guests had
deposited their wraps lay an array of millinery which
drew her irresistibly.</p>

<p>It was a huge four-poster bed which one could
mount only by the aid of a set of bedside steps, and so
high that the valance, draped around it like a skirt,
would have reached from her neck to her heels had
it been draped on her. It was a chintz valance
with birds of paradise patterned on its pink background,
and there was pink silk quilled into the quaint
tester overhead, reminding her of old Jeremy's
favorite quill dahlias.</p>

<p>Usually when she went into this room which was
seldom opened, she mounted the steps to gaze up
at that fascinating pink loveliness. Also she walked
around the valance, counting its birds of paradise.
She did not do so to-day. She knew from many
previous countings that there were exactly eighty-seven
and a half of those birds. The joining seam
cut off all but the magnificent tail of what would have
been the eighty-eighth.</p>

<p>Mounting the steps she leaned over, careful not
to touch the crocheted counterpane, which Tippy
always treated as if it were something sacred, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
looked at the hats spread out upon it. Then she laid
daring fingers on Cousin Mehitable's bonnet. It was
a temptation to know what she would look like if
she should grow up to be a widow and have to wear
an imposing head-gear like that with a white ruche
in front and a long black veil floating down behind.
The next instant she was tying the strings under her
chin.</p>

<p>It made her look like such an odd little dwarf of
a woman that she stuck out her tongue at her reflection
in the mirror. The grimace was so comical,
framed by the stately bonnet, that Georgina was
delighted. She twisted her face another way and
was still more amused at results. Wholly forgetful
of the fact that it was a mourning bonnet, she
went on making faces at herself until the sound of
voices suddenly growing louder, told her that the
door across the hall had opened. Someone was coming
across.</p>

<p>There was no time to take off the bonnet.
With a frightened gasp she dived under the bed,
with it still on, her heels disappearing just as someone
came into the room. The bed was so high she
could easily sit upright under it, but she was so
afraid that a cough or a sneeze might betray her,
that she drew up her knees and sat with her face
pressed against them hard. The long veil shrouded
her shoulders. She felt that she would surely die if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
anyone should notice that the bonnet was gone, or
happen to lift the valance and find her sitting there
with it on her head. Then she forgot her fear in
listening to what Cousin Mehitable was saying.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"THE TISHBITE"</div>


<div class='cap'>COUSIN MEHITABLE was speaking to Mrs.
Triplett, who seemed to be searching through
bureau drawers for something. Georgina could tell
what she was doing from the sounds which reached
her. These drawers always stuck, and had to be
jerked violently until the mirror rattled.</div>

<p>"Oh, don't bother about it, Maria. I just made
an excuse of wanting to see it, because I knew you
always kept it in here, and I wanted to get you off
by yourself for a minute's talk with you alone. Since
I've been in town I've heard so much about Justin
and the way he is doing that I wanted to ask somebody
who knew and who could tell me the straight
of it. What's this about his leaving the service and
going junketing off to the interior of China on some
mission of his own? Jane tells me he got a year's
leave of absence from the Navy just to study up
some outlandish disease that attacks the sailors in
foreign ports. She says why should he take a whole
year out of the best part of his life to poke around
the huts of dirty heathen to find out the kind of microbe
that's eating 'em? He'd ought to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Barbara and what's eating her heart out. I've taken
a great fancy to that girl, and I'd like to give Justin
a piece of my mind. It probably wouldn't do a bit
of good though. He always was peculiar."</p>

<p>Georgina could hear only a few words of the
answer because Tippy had her head in the closet now,
reaching for the box on the top shelf. She stopped
her search as soon as Cousin Mehitable said that, and
the two of them went over to the fire and talked in
low tones for a few minutes, leaning against the
mantel. Georgina heard a word now and then. Several
times it was her own name. Finally, in a louder
tone Cousin Mehitable said:</p>

<p>"Well, I wanted to know, and I was sure you
could tell me if anyone could."</p>

<p>They went back across the hall to the other guests.
The instant they were gone Georgina crawled out
from under the bed with the big bonnet cocked over
one eye. Then she scudded down the hall and up the
back stairs. She knew the company would be going
soon, and she would be expected to bid them good-bye
if she were there. She didn't want Cousin
Mehitable to kiss her again. She didn't like her
any more since she had called her father "peculiar."</p>

<p>She wandered aimlessly about for a few minutes,
then pushed the door open into Mrs. Triplett's room.
It was warm and cozy in there for a small fire still
burned in the little drum stove. She opened the front
damper to make it burn faster, and the light shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
out in four long rays which made a flickering in the
room. She sat down on the floor in front of it and
began to wonder.</p>

<p>"What did Cousin Mehitable mean by something
eating Barby's heart out?" Did people die of it?
She had read of the Spartan youth who let the fox
gnaw his vitals under his cloak and never showed,
even by the twitching of a muscle, that he was in
pain. Of course, she knew that no live thing was
tearing at her mother's heart, but what if something
that she couldn't understand was hurting her darling
Barby night and day and she was bravely hiding it
from the world like the Spartan youth?</p>

<p>Did <i>all</i> grown people have troubles? It had
seemed such a happy world until to-day, and now all
at once she had heard about Dan Darcy and Belle
Triplett. Nearly everyone whom the guests talked
about had borne some unhappiness, and even her own
father was "peculiar." She wished she hadn't found
out all these things. A great weight seemed to settle
down upon her.</p>

<p>Thinking of Barbara in the light of what she had
just learned she recalled that she often looked sorry
and disappointed, especially after the postman had
come and gone without leaving a letter. Only this
morning Tippy had said&mdash;could it be she thought
something was wrong and was trying to comfort her?</p>

<p>"Justin always was a poor hand for writing letters.
Many a time I've heard the Judge scolding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and stewing around because he hadn't heard from
him when he was away at school. Letter writing
came so easy to the Judge he couldn't understand why
Justin shirked it so."</p>

<p>Then Georgina thought of Belle in the light of
what she had just learned. Belle had carried her
around in her arms when she was first brought to
live in this old gray house by the sea. She had made
a companion of her whenever she came to visit her
Aunt Maria, and Georgina had admired her because
she was so pretty and blonde and gentle, and enjoyed
her because she was always so willing to do whatever
Georgina wished. And now to think that instead of
being the like-everybody-else kind of a young lady
she seemed, she was like a heroine in a book who
had lived through trouble which would "blight her
whole life."</p>

<p>Sitting there on the floor with her knees drawn up
and her chin resting on them, Georgina looked into
the fire through the slits of the damper and thought
and thought. Then she looked out through the little
square window-panes across the wind-swept dunes.
It did not seem like summer with the sky all overcast
with clouds. It was more like the end of a day
in the early autumn. Life seemed overcast, too.</p>

<p>Presently through a rift in the sky an early star
stole out, and she made a wish on it. That was one
of the things Belle had taught her. She started to
wish that Barby might be happy. But before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
whispered verse had entirely passed her lips she
stopped to amend it, adding Uncle Darcy's name and
Belle's. Then she stopped again, overcome by the
knowledge of all the woe in the world, and gathering
all the universe into her generous little heart she
exclaimed earnestly:</p>

<p>"I wish <i>everybody in the world could be happy</i>."</p>

<p>Having made the wish, fervently, almost fiercely,
in her intense desire to set things right, she scrambled
to her feet. There was another thing that Belle
had told her which she must do.</p>

<p>"If you open the Bible and it chances to be at a
chapter beginning with the words, 'It came to pass,'
the wish will come true without fail."</p>

<p>Taking Tippy's Bible from the stand beside the
bed, she opened it at random, then carried it over to
the stove in order to scan the pages by the firelight
streaming through the damper. The book opened
at First Kings, seventeenth chapter. She held it directly
in the broad rays examining the pages anxiously.
There was only that one chapter head on
either page, and alas, its opening words were not
"it came to pass." What she read with a sinking
heart was:</p>

<p>"<i>And Elijah the Tishbite.</i>"</p>

<p>Now Georgina hadn't the slightest idea what a
Tishbite was, but it sounded as if it were something
dreadful. Somehow it is a thousand times worse to
be scared by a fear which is not understood than by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
one which is familiar. Suddenly she felt as bewildered
and frightened as she had on that morning long
ago, when Jeremy's teeth went flying into the fire.
The happiness of her whole little world seemed to be
going to pieces.</p>

<p>Throwing herself across the foot of Tippy's bed
she crawled under the afghan thrown over it, even
burrowing her head beneath it in order to shut out
the dreadful things closing down on her. It had
puzzled and frightened her to know that something
was eating Barby's heart out, even in a figurative
way, and now the word "Tishbite" filled her with a
vague sense of helplessness and impending disaster.</p>

<p>Barbara, coming upstairs to hunt her after the
guests were gone, found her sound asleep with the
afghan still over her head. She folded it gently back
from the flushed face, not intending to waken her,
but Georgina's eyes opened and after a bewildered
stare around the room she sat up, remembering. She
had wakened to a world of trouble. Somehow it did
not seem quite so bad with Barbara standing over
her, smiling. When she went downstairs a little
later, freshly washed and brushed, the Tishbite rolled
out of her thoughts as a fog lifts when the sun shines.</p>

<p>But it came back at bedtime, when having said
her prayers, she joined her voice with Barbara's in
the hymn that had been her earliest lullaby. It was
a custom never omitted. It always closed the day
for her:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Eternal Father, strong to save,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, hear us when we cry to thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For those in peril on the sea."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>As they sang she stole an anxious glance at Barbara
several times. Then she made up her mind that
Cousin Mehitable was mistaken. If her father were
"peculiar," Barby wouldn't have that sweet look on
her face when she sang that prayer for him. If he
were making her unhappy she wouldn't be singing it
at all. She wouldn't care whether he was protected
or not "from rock and tempest, fire and foe."</p>

<p>And yet, after Barby had gone downstairs and
the sound of the piano came softly up from below&mdash;another
bedtime custom, Georgina began thinking
again about those whispering voices which she had
heard as she sat under the bed, behind the bird-of-paradise
valance. More than ever before the music
suggested someone waiting for a ship which never
came home, or fog bells on a lonely shore.</p>

<p>Nearly a week went by before Richard made his
first visit to the old gray house at the end of town.
He came with the Towncrier, carrying his bell, and
keeping close to his side for the first few minutes.
Then he found the place far more interesting than
the bungalow. Georgina took him all over it, from
the garret where she played on rainy days to the
seat up in the willow, where standing in its highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
crotch one could look clear across the Cape to the
Atlantic. They made several plans for their treasure-quest
while up in the willow. They could see a
place off towards Wood End Lighthouse which
looked like one of the pirate places Uncle Darcy
had described in one of his tales.</p>

<p>Barby had lemonade and cake waiting for them
when they came down, and when she talked to him
it wasn't at all in the way the ladies did who came
to see his Aunt Letty, as if they were talking merely
to be gracious and kind to a strange little boy in
whom they had no interest. Barby gave his ear a
tweak and said with a smile that made him feel as if
they had known each other always:</p>

<p>"Oh, the good times I've had with boys just your
size. I always played with my brother Eddy's
friends. Boys make such good chums. I've often
thought how much Georgina misses that I had."</p>

<p>Presently Georgina took him out to the see-saw,
where Captain Kidd persisted in riding on Richard's
end of the plank.</p>

<p>"That's exactly the way my Uncle Eddy's terrier
used to do back in Kentucky when I visited there one
summer," she said, after the plank was adjusted so
as to balance them properly. "Only he barked all
the time he was riding. But he was fierce because
Uncle Eddy fed him gunpowder."</p>

<p>"What did he do that for?"</p>

<p>"To keep him from being gun-shy. And Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Eddy ate some, too, one time when he was little,
because the colored stable boy told him it would make
him game."</p>

<p>"Did it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether that did or not. Something
did though, for he's the gamest man I know."</p>

<p>Richard considered this a moment and then said:</p>

<p>"I wonder what it would do to Captain Kidd if I
fed him some."</p>

<p>"Let's try it!" exclaimed Georgina, delighted with
the suggestion. "There's some hanging up in the
old powder-horn over the dining-room mantel. You
have to give it to 'em in milk. Wait a minute."</p>

<p>Jumping from the see-saw after giving fair warning,
she ran to one of the side windows.</p>

<p>"Barby," she called. "I'm going to give Captain
Kidd some milk."</p>

<p>Barbara turned from her conversation with Uncle
Darcy to say:</p>

<p>"Very well, if you can get it yourself. But be
careful not to disturb the pans that haven't been
skimmed. Tippy wouldn't like it."</p>

<p>"I know what to get it out of," called Georgina,
"out of the blue pitcher."</p>

<p>Richard watched while she opened the refrigerator
door and poured some milk into a saucer.</p>

<p>"Carry it in and put it on the kitchen table," she
bade him, "while I get the powder."</p>

<p>When he followed her into the dining-room she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was upon a chair, reaching for the old powder horn,
which hung on a hook under the firearm that had
done duty in the battle of Lexington. Richard
wanted to get his hands on it, and was glad when
she could not pull out the wooden plug which stopped
the small end of the horn. She turned it over to him
to open. He peered into it, then shook it.</p>

<p>"There isn't more than a spoonful left in it," he
said.</p>

<p>"Well, gunpowder is so strong you don't need
much. You know just a little will make a gun go off.
It mightn't be safe to feed him much. Pour some
out in your hand and drop it in the milk."</p>

<p>Richard slowly poured a small mound out into the
hollow of his hand, and passed the horn back to her,
then went to the kitchen whistling for Captain Kidd.
Not all of the powder went into the milk, however.
The last bit he swallowed himself, after looking at
it long and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Georgina, before putting
back the plug, paused, looked all around, and poured
out a few grains into her own hand. If the Tishbite
was going to do anybody any harm, it would be well
to be prepared. She had just hastily swallowed it
and was hanging the horn back in place, when Richard
returned.</p>

<p>"He lapped up the last drop as if he liked it," he
reported. "Now we'll see what happens."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TELEGRAM THAT TOOK BARBY AWAY</div>


<div class='cap'>THE painting of Richard's portrait interfered
with the quest for buried treasure from day to
day; but unbeknown either to artist or model, the
dreams of that quest helped in the fashioning of the
picture. In the preliminary sittings in the studio at
home Richard's father found it necessary always to
begin with some exhortation such as:</div>

<p>"Now, Dicky, this has <i>got</i> to be more than just
a 'Study of a Boy's Head.' I want to show by the
expression of your face that it is an illustration of
that poem, 'A boy's will is the wind's will, and the
thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.' Chase
that Binney Rogers and his gang out of your mind
for a while, can't you, and think of something beside
shinny and the hokey-pokey man."</p>

<p>So far the portrait was satisfactory in that it was
a remarkably good likeness of an unusually good-looking
boy, but it was of a boy who seemed to be
alertly listening for such things as Binney's cat-call,
signaling him from the alley. Here by the sea there
was no need for such exhortations. No sooner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he seated before the easel in the loft which served as
a studio, with its barn-like, double doors thrown open
above the water, than the rapt expression which his
father coveted, crept into his dark eyes. They grew
big and dreamy, following the white sails across the
harbor. He was planning the secret expedition he
and Georgina intended to undertake, just as soon as
the portrait was finished.</p>

<p>There were many preparations to make for it.
They would have to secrete tools and provisions; and
in a book from which Georgina read aloud whenever
there was opportunity, were descriptions of various
rites that it were well to perform. One was to sacrifice
a black cock, and sprinkle its blood upon the
spot before beginning to dig. Richard did not question
why this should be done. The book recommended
it as a practice which had been followed by
some very famous treasure hunters. If at times a
certain wide-awake and calculating gleam suddenly
dispelled the dreaminess of expression in which his
father was exulting, it was because a black Orpington
rooster which daily strayed from a nearby cottage
to the beach below the studio window, chose that
moment to crow. Richard had marked that black
cock for the sacrifice. It was lordly enough to bring
success upon any enterprise.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as soon as his duties as model
were over each morning, he was out of the studio
with a whoop and up the beach as hard as he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
run to the Huntingdon house. By the time he
reached it he was no longer the artist's only son,
hedged about with many limitations which belonged
to that distinction. He was "Dare-devil Dick, the
Dread Destroyer," and Georgina was "Gory
George, the Menace of the Main."</p>

<p>Together they commanded a brigantine of their
own. Passers-by saw only an old sailboat anchored
at the deserted and rotting wharf up nearest the
breakwater. But the passers-by who saw only that
failed to see either Dare-devil Dick or Gory George.
They saw, instead, two children whose fierce mustachios
were the streakings of a burnt match, whose
massive hoop ear-rings were the brass rings from a
curtain pole, whose faithful following of the acts
of Captain Quelch and other piratical gentlemen was
only the mimicry of play.</p>

<p>But Barbara knew how real they were, from the
spotted handkerchief tied around the "bunged eye"
of Dare-devil Dick, under his evil-looking slouch
hat, to the old horse pistol buckled to his belt. Gory
George wore the same. And Barbara knew what
serious business it was to them, even more serious
than the affairs of eating and drinking.</p>

<p>Tippy scolded when she found that her half-pint
bottles which she kept especially for cream had been
smuggled away in the hold of the brigantine. But
without bottles how could one give a realistic touch
to the singing of "Yo ho, and the rum below"?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>And Tippy thought it was heathenish for Barbara
to let Georgina dress up in some little knickerbockers
and a roundabout which had been stored away with
other clothes worn by Justin as a small boy. But
her disapproval was beyond words when Barbara
herself appeared at the back door one morning, so
cleverly disguised as a gypsy, that Mrs. Triplett
grudgingly handed out some cold biscuits before she
discovered the imposition. The poor she was glad
to feed, but she had no use for an impudent, strolling
gypsy.</p>

<p>"Don't be cross, Tippy," pleaded Barbara, laughing
till the tears came. "I <i>had</i> to do it. I can't bear
to feel that Georgina is growing away from me&mdash;that
she is satisfied to leave me out of her games.
Since she's so taken up with that little Richard Moreland
I don't seem as necessary to her as I used to
be. And I can't bear that, Tippy, when I've always
been first in everything with her. She's so necessary
to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett made no answer. She felt that she
couldn't do justice to the occasion. She doubted if
the Pilgrim monument itself could, even if it were
to stretch itself up to its full height and deliver a
lecture on the dignity of motherhood. She wondered
what the Mayflower mothers would have thought if
they could have met this modern one on the beach,
with face stained brown, playacting that she was a
beggar of a gypsy. How could she hope to be one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of those written of in Proverbs&mdash;"Her children rise
up and call her blessed. Her own works praise her
in the gates."</p>

<p>Tippy ate her dinner alone that day, glancing
grimly through the open window from time to time
to the sand dunes back of the house, where an old
hag of a gypsy in a short red dress with a gay bandanna
knotted over her head, broiled bacon and
boiled corn over a smoky campfire; and two swaggering
villains who smelled of tar and codfish (because
of the old net which half-way filled the brigantine),
sucked the very cobs when the corn was eaten from
them, forever registering that feast high above all
other feasts in the tablet of blessed memories.</p>

<p>The interruption to all this came as unexpectedly
as a clap of thunder from a clear sky. A messenger
boy on a wheel whirled up to the front gate with
a telegram. Tippy signed for it, not wanting the
boy to see Barbara in such outlandish dress, then
carried it out to the picnickers. She held it under her
apron until she reached them. Telegrams always
spelled trouble to Mrs. Triplett, but Barbara took
this one from her with a smiling thank you, without
rising from her seat on the sand. Her father often
telegraphed instead of writing when away on his vacations,
and she knew he was up at a lake resort in
Michigan, at an Editors' Convention. Telegrams
had always been pleasant things in her experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
But as she tore this open and read she turned pale
even under her brown stain.</p>

<p>"It's papa," she gasped. "Hurt in an automobile
accident. They don't say how bad&mdash;just hurt. And
he wants me. I must take the first train."</p>

<p>She looked up at Mrs. Triplett helplessly, not even
making an effort to rise from the sand, she was so
dazed and distressed by the sudden summons. It
was the first time she had ever had the shock of bad
news. It was the first time she had ever been called
upon to act for herself in such an emergency, and
she felt perfectly numb, mind and body. Tippy's
voice sounded a mile away when she said:</p>

<p>"You can catch the boat. It's an hour till the
<i>Dorothy Bradford</i> starts back to Boston."</p>

<p>Still Barbara sat limp and powerless, as one sits in
a nightmare.</p>

<p>Georgina gave a choking gasp as two awful words
rose up in her throat and stuck there. "<i>The Tishbite.</i>"
Whatever that mysterious horror might be,
plainly its evil workings had begun.</p>

<p>"Tut!" exclaimed Tippy, pulling Barbara to her
feet. "Keep your head. You'll have to begin scrubbing
that brown paint off your face if you expect to
reach the boat on time."</p>

<p>Automatically Georgina responded to that "tut"
as if it were the old challenge of the powder horn.
No matter how she shivered she must show what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
brave stuff she was made of. Even with that awful
foreboding clutching at her heart like an iron hand
and Barby about to leave her, she mustn't show one
sign of her distress.</p>

<p>It was well that Georgina had learned to move
briskly in her long following after Tippy, else she
could not have been of such service in this emergency.
Her eyes were blurred with tears as she hurried up
to the garret for suitcase and satchel, and down the
hall to look up numbers in the telephone directory.
But it was a comfort even in the midst of her distress
to feel that she could take such an important part in
the preparations, that Tippy trusted her to do the
necessary telephoning, and to put up a lunch for
Barby without dictating either the messages or the
contents of the lunch-box.</p>

<p>When Mr. James Milford called up, immediately
after Richard had raced home with the news, and
offered to take Mrs. Huntingdon to the boat in his
machine, he thought it was Mrs. Huntingdon herself
who answered him. The trembling voice seemed
only natural under the circumstances. He would
have smiled could he have seen the pathetic little face
uplifted towards the receiver, the quivering lip still
adorned with the fierce mustachios of Gory George,
in strange contrast to the soft curls hanging over her
shoulders now that they were no longer hidden by a
piratical hat. She had forgotten that she was in
knickerbockers instead of skirts, and that the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
horse-pistol was still at her belt, until Barbara caught
her to her at parting with a laugh that turned into
a sob, looking for a spot on her face clean enough to
kiss.</p>

<p>It was all over so soon&mdash;the machine whirling up
to the door and away again to stop at the bank an
instant for the money which Georgina had telephoned
to have waiting, and then on to the railroad wharf
where the <i>Dorothy Bradford</i> had already sounded
her first warning whistle. Georgina had no time to
realize what was actually happening until it was over.
She climbed up into the mammoth willow tree in the
corner of the yard to watch for the steamboat. It
would come into view in a few minutes as it ploughed
majestically through the water towards the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Then desolation fell upon her. She had never
realized until that moment how dear her mother was
to her. Then the thought came to her, suppose it
was Barby who had been hurt in an accident, and
she Georgina, was hurrying to her as Barby was hurrying
to grandfather Shirley, unknowing what
awaited her at the journey's end. For a moment she
forgot her own unhappiness at being left behind, in
sympathetic understanding of her mother's distress.
She wasn't going to think about her part of it she
told herself, she was going to be so brave&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then her glance fell on the "holiday tree."</p>

<p>The holiday tree was a little evergreen of Barby's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
christening if not of her planting. For every gala
day in the year it bore strange fruit, no matter what
the season. At Hallowe'en it was as gay with jack-o-lanterns
and witches' caps as if the pixies themselves
had decorated it. On Washington's birthday
each branch was tipped with a flag and a cherry tart.
On the fourteenth of February it was hung with valentines,
and at Easter she was always sure of finding
a candy rabbit or two perched among its branches
and nests of colored eggs. It seemed to be at its
best at Christmas, but it was when it took its turns at
birthday celebrations that it was most wonderful.
Then it blossomed with little glass lanterns of every
color, glowing like red and green and golden stars.
Last year it had borne a great toy ship with all sails
set, and nine "surprise" oranges, round, yellow boxes,
each containing a gift, because she was nine years
old. In just two more days she would be ten, and
Barby gone!</p>

<p>At that instant the boat whistle sounded long and
deep, sending its melodious boom across the water.
It seemed to strike some chord in the very center of
her being, and make her feel as if something inside
were sinking down and down and down. The sensation
was sickening. It grew worse as the boat
steamed away. She stood up on a limb to watch it.
Smaller and smaller it seemed, leaving only a long
plume of smoke in its wake as it disappeared around
Long Point. Then even the smoke faded, and a forlorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
little figure, strangely at variance with the fierce
pirate suit, she crumpled up in the crotch of the willow,
her face hidden in her elbow, and began to sob
piteously: "Oh, Barby! Barby!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BIRTHDAY PRISM</div>


<div class='cap'>THE Towncrier, passing along the street on an
early morning trip to the bakery, stopped at the
door of the antique shop, for a word with Mrs.
Yates, the lady who kept it. She wanted him to
"cry" an especial bargain sale of old lamps later in
the week. That is how he happened to be standing
in the front door when the crash came in the rear of
the shop, and it was because he was standing there
that the crash came.</div>

<p>Because Mrs. Yates was talking to him she
couldn't be at the back door when the fish-boy came
with the fish, and nobody being there to take it the
instant he knocked, the boy looked in and threw it
down on the table nearest the door. And because the
fish was left to lie there a moment while Mrs. Yates
finished her conversation, the cat, stretched out on
the high window ledge above the table, decided to
have his breakfast without waiting to be called. He
was an enormous cat by the name of "Grandpa,"
and because he was old and ponderous, and no longer
light on his feet, when he leaped from the window-sill
he came down clumsily in the middle of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
table full of the old lamps which were set aside for
the bargain sale.</p>

<p>Of course, it was the biggest and fanciest lamp
in the lot that was broken&mdash;a tall one with a frosted
glass shade and a row of crystal prisms dangling
around the bowl of it. It toppled over on to a pair
of old brass andirons, smashing into a thousand
pieces. Bits of glass flew in every direction, and
"Grandpa," his fur electrified by his fright until he
looked twice his natural size, shot through the door
as if fired from a cannon, and was seen no more
that morning.</p>

<p>Naturally, Mrs. Yates hurried to the back of the
store to see what had happened, and Mr. Darcy, following,
picked up from the wreck the only piece of
the lamp not shattered to bits by the fall. It was one
of the prisms, which in some miraculous way had
survived the crash, a beautiful crystal pendant without
a single nick or crack.</p>

<p>He picked it up and rubbed his coat sleeve down
each of its three sides, and when he held it up to the
light it sent a ripple of rainbows dancing across the
shop. He watched them, pleased as a child; and
when Mrs. Yates, loud in her complaints of Grandpa,
came with broom and dustpan to sweep up the litter,
he bargained with her for the prism.</p>

<p>That is how he happened to have an offering for
Georgina's birthday when he reached the house a
couple of hours later, not knowing that it was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
birthday. Nobody had remembered it, Barby being
gone.</p>

<p>It seemed to Georgina the forlornest day she had
ever opened her eyes upon. The very fact that it
was gloriously sunny with a delicious summer breeze
ruffling the harbor and sending the white sails scudding
along like wings, made her feel all the more
desolate. She was trying her best to forget what day
it was, but there wasn't much to keep her mind off the
subject. Even opportunities for helping Tippy were
taken away, for Belle had come to stay during Barby's
absence, and she insisted on doing what Georgina
otherwise would have done.</p>

<p>If Barby had been at home there would have been
no piano practice on such a gala occasion as a tenth
birthday. There would have been no time for it in
the program of joyful happenings. But because time
dragged, Georgina went to her scales and five-finger
exercises as usual. With the hour-glass on the piano
beside her, she practised not only her accustomed
time, till the sand had run half through, but until all
but a quarter of it had slipped down. Then she
sauntered listlessly out into the dining-room and
stood by one of the open windows, looking out
through the wire screen into the garden.</p>

<p>On any other day she would have found entertainment
in the kitchen listening to Belle and Mrs.
Triplett. Belle seemed doubly interesting now that
she had heard of the unused wedding dress and the
sorrow that would "blight her whole life." But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Georgina did not want anyone to see how bitterly she
was disappointed.</p>

<p>Just outside, so close to the window that she could
have reached out and touched it had it not been for
the screen, stood the holiday tree. It had held out
its laden arms to her on so many festal occasions
that Georgina had grown to feel that it took a human
interest in all her celebrations. To see it standing
bare now, like any ordinary tree, made her feel that
her last friend was indifferent. Nobody cared. Nobody
was glad that she was in the world. In spite of
all she could do to check them, two big tears welled
up and rolled down her cheeks; then another and another.
She lifted up the hem of her dress to wipe
them away, and as she did so Uncle Darcy came
around the house.</p>

<p>He looked in at the open window, then asked:
"Weather a bit squally, hey? Better put into port
and tie up till storm's over. Let your Uncle Darcy
have a hand at the helm. Come out here, Barby, and
let's talk it over on the door-step."</p>

<p>There was something so heartening in the cheery
voice that Georgina made one more dab at her eyes
with the hem of her dress skirt, then dropped it and
went out through the screen door to join him on the
steps which led down into the garden. At first she
was loath to confess the cause of her tears. She felt
ashamed of being caught crying simply because no
one had remembered the date. It wasn't that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
wanted presents, she sobbed. It was that she wanted
someone to be glad that she'd been born and it was
so lonesome without Barby&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the midst of her reluctant confession Mr.
Darcy bethought himself of the prism in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, drawing it out. "Take this and
put a rainbow around your troubles. It's a sort of
magic glass. When you look through it, it shows
you things you can't see with your ordinary eyes.
Look what it does to the holiday tree."</p>

<p>There was a long-drawn breath of amazement
from Georgina as she held the prism to her eyes and
looked through it at the tree.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! It <i>does</i> put a rainbow around every
branch and every little tuft of green needles. It's
even lovelier than the colored lanterns were. Isn't
it wonderful? It puts a rainbow around the whole
outdoors."</p>

<p>Her gaze went from the grape arbor to the back
garden gate. Then she jumped up and started
around the house, the old man following, and smiling
over each enthusiastic "oh" she uttered, as the prism
showed her new beauty at every step. He was
pleased to have been the source of her new pleasure.</p>

<p>"It's like looking into a different world," she cried,
as she reached the kitchen door, and eagerly turned
the prism from one object to another. Mrs. Triplett
was scowling intently over the task of trying to
turn the lid of a glass jar which refused to budge.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it even puts a rainbow around Tippy's
frown," Georgina cried excitedly. Then she ran to
hold the prism over Belle's eyes.</p>

<p>"Look, what Uncle Darcy brought me for my
birthday. See how it puts a rainbow around every
blessed thing, even the old black pots and pans!"</p>

<p>In showing it to Tippy she discovered a tiny hole
in the end of the prism by which it had been hung
from the lamp, and she ran upstairs to find a piece
of ribbon to run through it. When she came down
again, the prism hanging from her neck by a long
pink ribbon, Uncle Darcy greeted her with a new
version of the Banbury Cross song:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Rings on her fingers and ribbon of rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She shall have rainbows wherever she goes."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>"That's even better than having music wherever
you go," answered Georgina, whirling around on her
toes. Then she stopped in a listening attitude, hearing
the postman.</p>

<p>When she came back from the front door with
only a magazine her disappointment was keen, but
she said bravely:</p>

<p>"Of course, I <i>knew</i> there couldn't be a letter from
Barby this soon. She couldn't get there till last night&mdash;but
just for a minute I couldn't help hoping&mdash;but
I didn't mind it half so much, Uncle Darcy, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
looked at the postman through the prism. Even his
whiskers were blue and red and yellow."</p>

<p>That afternoon a little boat went dipping up and
down across the waves. It was <i>The Betsey</i>, with
Uncle Darcy pulling at the oars and Georgina as
passenger. Lifting the prism which still hung from
her neck by the pink ribbon, she looked out upon
what seemed to be an enchanted harbor. It was
filled with a fleet of rainbows. Every sail was outlined
with one, every mast edged with lines of red
and gold and blue. Even the gray wharves were
tinged with magical color, and the water itself, to
her reverent thought, suggested the "sea of glass
mingled with fire," which is pictured as one of the
glories of the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"Isn't it <i>wonderful</i>, Uncle Darcy?" she asked in
a hushed, awed tone. "It's just like a miracle the way
this bit of glass changes the whole world. Isn't it?"</p>

<p>Before he could answer, a shrill whistle sounded
near at hand. They were passing the boathouse on
the beach below the Green Stairs. Looking up they
saw Richard, hanging out of the open doors of the
loft, waving to them. Georgina stood up in the boat
and beckoned, but he shook his head, pointing backward
with his thumb into the studio, and disconsolately
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"He wants to go <i>so</i> bad!" exclaimed Georgina.
"Seems as if his father's a mighty slow painter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Maybe if you'd ask him the way you did before,
Uncle Darcy, he'd let Richard off this one more time&mdash;being
my birthday, you know."</p>

<p>She looked at him with the bewitching smile which
he usually found impossible to resist, but this time
he shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, I don't want him along to-day. I've brought
you out here to show you something and have a little
talk with you alone. Maybe I ought to wait till
you're older before I say what I want to say, but at
my time of life I'm liable to slip off without much
warning, and I don't want to go till I've said it to
you."</p>

<p>Georgina put down her prism to stare at him in
eager-eyed wonder. She was curious to know what
he could show her out here on the water, and what
he wanted to tell her that was as important as his
solemn words implied.</p>

<p>"Wait till we come to it," he said, answering the
unspoken question in her eyes. And Georgina, who
dearly loved dramatic effects in her own story-telling,
waited for something&mdash;she knew not what&mdash;to burst
upon her expectant sight.</p>

<p>They followed the line of the beach for some time,
dodging in between motor boats and launches, under
the high railroad wharf and around the smaller ones
where the old fish-houses stood. Past groups of
children, playing in the sand they went, past artists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sketching under their white umbrellas, past gardens
gay with bright masses of color, past drying nets
spread out on the shore.</p>

<p>Presently Uncle Darcy stopped rowing and
pointed across a vacant strip of beach between two
houses, to one on the opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>"There it is," he announced. "That's what I
wanted to show you."</p>

<p>Georgina followed the direction of his pointing
finger.</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" she said in a disappointed tone. "I've
seen that all my life. It's nothing but the Figurehead
House."</p>

<p>She was looking at a large white house with a
portico over the front door, on the roof of which
portico was perched half of the wooden figure of a
woman. It was of heroic size, head thrown back as
if looking off to sea, and with a green wreath in its
hands. Weather-beaten and discolored, it was not
an imposing object at first glance, and many a jibe
and laugh it had called forth from passing tourists.</p>

<p>Georgina's disappointment showed in her face.</p>

<p>"I know all about that," she remarked. "Mrs.
Tupman told me herself. She calls it the Lady of
Mystery. She said that years and years ago a
schooner put out from this town on a whaling cruise,
and was gone more than a year. When it was crossing
the equator, headed for home, the look-out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the masthead saw a strange object in the water that
looked like a woman afloat. The Captain gave orders
to lower the boats, and when they did so they
found this figurehead. She said it must have come
from the prow of some great clipper in the East
India trade. They were in the Indian Ocean, you
know.</p>

<p>"There had been some frightful storms and afterwards
they heard of many wrecks. This figurehead
was so long they had to cut it in two to get it into
the hold of the vessel. They brought it home and
set it up there over the front door, and they call it
the Lady of Mystery, because they said 'from whence
that ship came, what was its fate and what was its
destination will always be shrouded in mystery.' And
Mrs. Tupman said that a famous artist looked at it
once and said it was probably the work of a Spanish
artist, and that from the pose of its head and the
wreath in its hands he was sure it was intended to
represent Hope. Was <i>that</i> what you were going to
tell me?"</p>

<p>The old man had rested on his oars while she hurried
through this tale, with a mischievous twinkle in
her eyes, as if she thought she was forestalling him.
Now he picked them up again and began rowing out
into the harbor.</p>

<p>"That was a part of it," he admitted, "but that's
only the part that the whole town knows. That old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
figurehead has a meaning for me that nobody else
that's living knows about. That's what I want to
pass on to you."</p>

<p>He rowed several minutes more before he said
slowly, with a wistful tenderness coming into his dim
old eyes as he looked at her:</p>

<p>"Georgina, I don't suppose anybody's ever told
you about the troubles I've had. They wouldn't talk
about such things to a child like you. Maybe I
shouldn't, now; but when I saw how disappointed
you were this morning, I said to myself, 'If she's old
enough to feel trouble that way, she's old enough to
understand and to be helped by hearing about
mine.'"</p>

<p>It seemed hard for him to go on, for again he
paused, looking off toward the lighthouse in the distance.
Then he said slowly, in a voice that shook
at times:</p>

<p>"Once&mdash;I had a boy&mdash;that I set all my hopes on&mdash;just
as a man puts all his cargo into one vessel; and
nobody was ever prouder than I was, when that little
craft went sailing along with the best of them. I
used to look at him and think, '<i>Danny'll</i> weather the
seas no matter how rough they are, and he'll bring up
in the harbor I'm hoping he'll reach, with all flags
flying.' And then&mdash;something went wrong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tremulous voice broke. "My little ship went
down&mdash;all my precious cargo lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another and a longer pause. In it Georgina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
seemed to hear Cousin Mehitable's husky voice, half
whispering:</p>

<p>"<i>And the lamp threw a shadow on the yellow
blind, plain as a photograph. The shadow of an old
man sitting with his arms flung out across the table
and his head bowed on them. And he was groaning,
'Oh, my Danny! My Danny! If you could only
have gone that way.'</i>"</p>

<p>For a moment Georgina felt the cruel hurt of his
grief as if the pain had stabbed her own heart. The
old man went on:</p>

<p>"If it had only been any other kind of a load, anything
but <i>disgrace</i>, I could have carried it without
flinching. But <i>that</i>, it seemed I just couldn't face.
Only the good Lord knows how I lived through those
first few weeks. Then your grandfather Huntingdon
came to me. He was always a good friend. And he
asked me to row him out here on the water. When
we passed the Figurehead House he pointed up at that
head. It was all white and fair in those days, before
the paint wore off. And he said, 'Dan'l Darcy, <i>as
long as a man keeps Hope at the prow he keeps
afloat</i>. As soon as he drops it he goes to pieces and
down to the bottom, the way that ship did when it
lost its figurehead. You mustn't let go, Dan'l. You
<i>must</i> keep Hope at the prow.</p>

<p>"'Somewhere in God's universe either in this
world or another your boy is alive and still your son.
You've got to go on hoping that if he's innocent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
name will be cleared of this disgrace, and if he's
guilty he'll wipe out the old score against him some
way and make good.'</p>

<p>"And then he gave me a line to live by. A line
he said that had been written by a man who was
stone blind, and hadn't anything to look forward to
all the rest of his life but groping in the dark. He
said he'd not</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i><span style="margin-left: 15em;">"'Bate a jot</span><br />
Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer<br />
Right onward.</i>'<br />
</div>

<p>"At first it didn't seem to mean anything to me, but
he made me say it after him as if it were a sort of
promise, and I've been saying it every day of every
year since then. I'd said it to myself first, when I
met people on the street that I knew were thinking
of Danny's disgrace, and I didn't see how I was
going to get up courage to pass 'em. And I said it
when I was lying on my bed at night with my heart
so sore and heavy I couldn't sleep, and after a while
it did begin to put courage into me, so that I could
hope in earnest. And when I did <i>that</i>, little
lass&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He leaned over to smile into her eyes, now full
of tears, he had so wrought upon her tender sympathies&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I did that, it put a rainbow around my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
trouble just as that prism did around your empty
holiday tree. It changed the looks of the whole
world for me.</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> what I brought you out here to tell you,
Georgina. I want to give you the same thing that
your grandfather Huntingdon gave me&mdash;that line to
live by. Because troubles come to everybody.
They'll come to you, too, but I want you to know this,
Baby, they can't hurt you as long as you keep Hope
at the prow, because Hope is a magic glass that
makes rainbows of our tears. Now you won't forget
that, will you? Even after Uncle Darcy is dead and
gone, you'll remember that he brought you out here
on your birthday to give you that good word&mdash;'<i>still
bear up and steer right onward</i>,' no matter what
happens. And to tell you that in all the long, hard
years he's lived through, he's proved it was good."</p>

<p>Georgina, awed and touched of soul, could only
nod her assent. But because Childhood sometimes
has no answer to make to the confidences of Age is
no reason that they are not taken to heart and stowed
away there for the years to build upon. In the unbroken
silence with which they rowed back to shore,
Georgina might have claimed three score years besides
her own ten, so perfect was the feeling of comradeship
between them.</p>

<p>As they passed the pier back of the antique shop,
a great gray cat rose and stretched itself, then walked
ponderously down to the water's edge. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"Grandpa." Georgina, laughing a little shakily because
of recent tears, raised her prism to put a rainbow
around the cat's tail, unknowing that but for him
the crystal pendant would now be hanging from an
antique lamp instead of from the ribbon around her
neck.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MOVING PICTURES</div>


<div class='cap'>IT often happens that when one is all primed and
cocked for trouble, that trouble flaps its wings
and flies away for a time, leaving nothing to fire at.
So Georgina, going home with her prism and her
"line to live by," ready and eager to prove how
bravely she could meet disappointments, found only
pleasant surprises awaiting her.</div>

<p>Mrs. Triplett had made a birthday cake in her absence.
It was on the supper table with ten red
candles atop. And there was a note from Barby beside
her plate which had come in the last mail. It
had been posted at some way-station. There was a
check inside for a dollar which she was to spend as
she pleased. A dear little note it was, which made
Georgina's throat ache even while it brought a glow
to her heart. Then Belle, who had not known it was
her birthday in time to make her a present, announced
that she would take her to a moving picture
show after supper, instead.</p>

<p>Georgina had frequently been taken to afternoon
performances, but never at night. It was an adventure
in itself just to be down in the part of town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
where the shops were, when they were all lighted, and
when the summer people were surging along the
board-walk and out into the middle of the narrow
street in such crowds that the automobiles and "accommodations"
had to push their way through
slowly, with a great honking of warning horns.</p>

<p>The Town Hall was lighted for a dance when
they passed it. The windows of the little souvenir
shops seemed twice as attractive as when seen by day,
and early as it was in the evening, people were already
lined up in the drug-store, three deep around
the soda-water fountain.</p>

<p>Georgina, thankful that Tippy had allowed her to
wear her gold locket for the occasion, walked down
the aisle and took her seat near the stage, feeling as
conspicuous and self-conscious as any debutante entering
a box at Grand Opera.</p>

<p>It was a hot night, but on a line with the front
seats, there was a double side door opening out onto
a dock. From where Georgina sat she could look out
through the door and see the lights of a hundred
boats twinkling in long wavy lines across the black
water, and now and then a salt breeze with the fishy
tang she loved, stole across the room and touched her
cheek like a cool finger.</p>

<p>The play was not one which Barbara would have
chosen for Georgina to see, being one that was advertised
as a thriller. It was full of hair-breadth escapes
and tragic scenes. There was a shipwreck in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it, and passengers were brought ashore in the
breeches buoy, just as she had seen sailors brought
in on practice days over at the Race Point Life-saving
station. And there was a still form stretched
out stark and dripping under a piece of tarpaulin,
and a girl with long fair hair streaming wildly over
her shoulders knelt beside it wringing her hands.</p>

<p>Georgina stole a quick side-glance at Belle. That
was the way it had been in the story of Emmett Potter's
drowning, as they told it on the day of Cousin
Mehitable's visit. Belle's hands were locked together
in her lap, and her lips were pressed in a thin
line as if she were trying to keep from saying something.
Several times in the semi-darkness of the
house her handkerchief went furtively to her eyes.</p>

<p>Georgina's heart beat faster. Somehow, with the
piano pounding out that deep tum-tum, like waves
booming up on the rocks, she began to feel strangely
confused, as if <i>she</i> were the heroine on the films;
as if <i>she</i> were kneeling there on the shore in that
tragic moment of parting from her dead lover. She
was sure that she knew exactly how Belle felt then,
how she was feeling now.</p>

<p>When the lights were switched on again and they
rose to go out, Georgina was so deeply under the
spell of the play that it gave her a little shock of
surprise when Belle began talking quite cheerfully
and in her ordinary manner to her next neighbor.
She even laughed in response to some joking remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as they edged their way slowly up the aisle to the
door. It seemed to Georgina that if she had lived
through a scene like the one they had just witnessed,
she could never smile again. On the way out she
glanced up again at Belle several times, wondering.</p>

<p>Going home the street was even more crowded
than it had been coming. They could barely push
their way along, and were bumped into constantly
by people dodging back to escape the jam when the
crowd had to part to let a vehicle through. But after
a few blocks of such jostling the going was easier.
The drug-store absorbed part of the throng, and
most of the procession turned up Carver Street to
the Gifford House and the cottages beyond on Bradford
Street.</p>

<p>By the time Georgina and Belle came to the last
half-mile of the plank walk, scarcely a footstep
sounded behind them. After passing the Green
Stairs there was an unobstructed view of the harbor.
A full moon was high overhead, flooding the water
and beach with such a witchery of light that Georgina
moved along as if she were in a dream&mdash;in a
silver dream beside a silver sea.</p>

<p>Belle pointed to a little pavilion in sight of the
breakwater. "Let's go over there and sit down a
few minutes," she said. "It's a waste of good material
to go indoors on a night like this."</p>

<p>They crossed over, sinking in the sand as they
stepped from the road to the beach, till Georgina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had to take off her slippers and shake them before
she could settle down comfortably on the bench in
the pavilion. They sat there a while without speaking,
just as they had sat before the pictures on the
films, for never on any film was ever shown a scene
of such entrancing loveliness as the one spread out
before them. In the broad path made by the moon
hung ghostly sails, rose great masts, twinkled
myriads of lights. It was so still they could hear
the swish of the tide creeping up below, the dip of
near-by oars and the chug of a motor boat, far away
down by the railroad wharf.</p>

<p>Then Belle began to talk. She looked straight out
across the shining path of the moon and spoke as if
she were by herself. She did not look at Georgina,
sitting there beside her. Perhaps if she had, she
would have realized that her listener was only a
child and would not have said all she did. Or maybe,
something within her felt the influence of the night,
the magical drawing of the moon as the tide feels it,
and she could not hold back the long-repressed
speech that rose to her lips. Maybe it was that the
play they had seen, quickened old memories into painful
life again.</p>

<p>It was on a night just like this, she told Georgina,
that Emmett first told her that he cared for her&mdash;ten
years ago this summer. Ten years! The whole
of Georgina's little lifetime! And now Belle was
twenty-seven. Twenty-seven seemed very old to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Georgina. She stole another upward glance at her
companion. Belle did not look old, sitting there in
her white dress, like a white moonflower in that silver
radiance, a little lock of soft blonde hair fluttering
across her cheek.</p>

<p>In a rush of broken sentences with long pauses between
which somehow told almost as much as words,
Belle recalled some of the scenes of that summer, and
Georgina, who up to this night had only glimpsed the
dim outlines of romance, as a child of ten would
glimpse them through old books, suddenly saw it
face to face, and thereafter found it something to
wonder about and dream sweet, vague dreams over.</p>

<p>Suddenly Belle stood up with a complete change
of manner.</p>

<p>"My! it must be getting late," she said briskly.
"Aunt Maria will scold if I keep you out any longer."</p>

<p>Going home, she was like the Belle whom Georgina
had always known&mdash;so different from the one
lifting the veil of memories for the little while they
sat in the pavilion.</p>

<p>Georgina had thought that with no Barby to "button
her eyes shut with a kiss" at the end of her birthday,
the going-to-sleep time would be sad. But she
was so busy recalling the events of the day that she
never thought of the omitted ceremony. For a long
time she lay awake, imagining all sorts of beautiful
scenes in which she was the heroine.</p>

<p>First, she went back to what Uncle Darcy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
told her, and imagined herself as rescuing an only
child who was drowning. The whole town stood by
and cheered when she came up with it, dripping, and
the mother took her in her arms and said, "<i>You</i> are
our prism, Georgina Huntingdon! But for your
noble act our lives would be, indeed, desolate. It
is you who have filled them with rainbows."</p>

<p>Then she was in a ship crossing the ocean, and a
poor sailor hearing her speak of Cape Cod would
come and ask her to tell him of its people, and she
would find he was Danny. She would be the means
of restoring him to his parents.</p>

<p>And then, she and Richard on some of their treasure-hunting
expeditions which they were still planning
every time they met, would unearth a casket
some dark night by the light of a fitful lantern, and
inside would be a confession written by the man who
had really stolen the money, saying that Dan Darcy
was innocent. And Uncle Darcy and Aunt Elspeth
would be so heavenly glad&mdash;&mdash;The tears came to
Georgina's eyes as she pictured the scene in the little
house in Fishburn Court, it came to her so vividly.</p>

<p>The clock downstairs struck twelve, but still she
went on with the pleasing pictures moving through
her mind as they had moved across the films earlier
in the evening. The last one was a combination of
what she had seen there and what Belle had told
her.</p>

<p>She was sitting beside a silver sea across which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a silver moon was making a wonderful shining path
of silver ripples, and somebody was telling her&mdash;what
Emmett had told Belle ten years ago. And she
knew past all doubting that if that shadowy somebody
beside her should die, she would carry the memory
of him to her grave as Belle was doing. It
seemed such a sweet, sad way to live that she thought
it would be more interesting to have her life like that,
than to have it go along like the lives of all the married
people of her acquaintance. And if <i>he</i> had a
father like Emmett's father she would cling to him
as Belle did, and go to see him often and take the
part of a real daughter to him. But she wouldn't
want him to be like Belle's "Father Potter." He was
an old fisherman, too crippled to follow the sea any
longer, so now he was just a mender of nets, sitting
all day knotting twine with dirty tar-blackened fingers.</p>

<p>The next morning when she went downstairs it
was Belle and not Mrs. Triplett who was stepping
about the kitchen in a big gingham apron, preparing
breakfast. Mrs. Triplett was still in bed. Such a
thing had never happened before within Georgina's
recollection.</p>

<p>"It's the rheumatism in her back," Belle reported.
"It's so bad she can't lie still with any comfort, and
she can't move without groaning. So she's sort of
'between the de'il and the deep sea.' And touchy is
no name for it. She doesn't like it if you don't and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
she doesn't like it if you do; but you can't wonder
when the pain's so bad. It's pretty near lumbago."</p>

<p>Georgina, who had finished her dressing by tying
the prism around her neck, was still burning with the
desire which Uncle Darcy's talk had kindled within
her, to be a little comfort to everybody.</p>

<p>"Let me take her toast and tea up to her," she
begged. With that toast and tea she intended to
pass along the good word Uncle Darcy had given
her&mdash;"the line to live by." But Tippy was in no
humor to be adjured by a chit of a child to bear up
and steer right onward. Such advice would have
been coldly received just then even from her minister.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about," she
exclaimed testily. "Bear up? Of course I'll bear
up. There's nothing else <i>to</i> do with rheumatism, but
you needn't come around with any talk of putting
rainbows around it or me either."</p>

<p>She gave her pillow an impatient thump with her
hard knuckles.</p>

<p>"Deliver me from people who make it their business
in life always to act cheerful no matter <i>what</i>.
The Scripture itself says 'There's a time to laugh
and a time to weep, a time to mourn and a time to
dance.' When the weeping time comes I can't abide
either people or books that go around spreading
cheerful sayings on everybody like salve!"</p>

<p>Tippy, lying there with her hair screwed into a
tight little button on the top of her head, looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
strangely unlike herself. Georgina descended to the
kitchen, much offended. It hurt her feelings to have
her good offices spurned in such a way. She didn't
care how bad anybody's rheumatism was she muttered.
"It was no excuse for saying such nasty things
to people who were trying to be kind to them."</p>

<p>Belle suggested presently that the customary piano
practice be omitted that morning for fear it might
disturb Aunt Maria, so when the usual little tasks
were done Georgina would have found time dragging,
had it not been for the night letter which a
messenger boy brought soon after breakfast. Grandfather
Shirley was better than she had expected to
find him, Barby wired. Particulars would follow
soon in a letter. It cheered Georgina up so much
that she took a pencil and tablet of paper up into the
willow tree and wrote a long account to her mother
of the birthday happenings. What with the red-candled
cake and the picture show and the afternoon
in the boat it sounded as if she had had a very happy
day. But mostly she wrote about the prism, and what
Uncle Darcy had told her about the magic glass of
Hope. When it was done she went in to Belle.</p>

<p>"May I go down to the post-office to mail this and
stop on my way back at the Green Stairs and see if
Richard can come and play with me?" she asked.</p>

<p>Belle considered. "Better stay down at the Milford's
to do your playing," she answered. "It might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
bother Aunt Maria to have a boy romping around
here."</p>

<p>So Georgina fared forth, after taking off her prism
and hanging it in a safe place. Only Captain Kidd
frisked down to meet her when she stood under the
studio window and gave the alley yodel which Richard
had taught her. There was no answer. She repeated
it several times, and then Mr. Moreland appeared
at the window, in his artist's smock with a palette
on his thumb and a decidedly impatient expression
on his handsome face. Richard was posing, he
told her, and couldn't leave for half an hour. His
tone was impatient, too, for he had just gotten a
good start after many interruptions.</p>

<p>Undecided whether to go back home or sit down
on the sand and wait, Georgina stood looking idly
about her. And while she hesitated, Manuel and
Joseph and Rosa came straggling along the beach in
search of adventure.</p>

<p>It came to Georgina like an inspiration that it
wasn't Barby who had forbidden her to play with
them, it was Tippy. And with a vague feeling that
she was justified in disobeying her because of her
recent crossness, she rounded them up for a chase
over the granite slabs of the breakwater. If they
would be Indians, she proposed, she'd be the Deer-slayer,
like the hero of the Leather-Stocking Tales,
and chase 'em with a gun.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>They had never heard of those tales, but they were
more than willing to undertake any game which Georgina
might propose. So after a little coaching
in war-whoops, with a battered tin pan for a tom-tom,
three impromptu Indians sped down the beach under
the studio windows, pursued by a swift-footed Deer-slayer
with flying curls. The end of a broken oar
was her musket, which she brandished fiercely as she
echoed their yells.</p>

<p>Mr. Moreland gave a groan of despair as he
looked at his model when those war-whoops broke
loose. Richard, who had succeeded after many trials
in lapsing into the dreamy attitude which his father
wanted, started up at the first whoop, so alert and
interested that his nostrils quivered. He scented excitement
of some kind and was so eager to be in the
midst of it that the noise of the tom-tom made him
wriggle in his chair.</p>

<p>He looked at his father appealingly, then made
an effort to settle down into his former attitude. His
body assumed the same listless pose as before, but
his eyes were so eager and shining with interest that
they fairly spoke each time the rattly drumming on
the tin pan sounded a challenge.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Dicky," said his father at last. "It's
all up with us for this time. You might as well go
on. But I wish that little tom-boy had stayed at
home."</p>

<p>And Richard went, with a yell and a hand-spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to throw in his lot with Manuel and Joseph and be
chased by the doughty Deer-slayer and her hound.
In the readjustment of parts Rosa was told to answer
to the name of Hector. It was all one to Rosa
whether she was hound or redskin, so long as she
was allowed a part in the thrilling new game. Richard
had the promise of being Deer-slayer next time
they played it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE OLD RIFLE GIVES UP ITS SECRET</div>


<div class='cap'>OUT of that game with forbidden playmates, grew
events which changed the lives of several people.
It began by Richard's deciding that a real gun
was necessary for his equipment if he was to play
the part of Leather-Stocking properly. Also, he
argued, it would be a valuable addition to their stock
of fire-arms. The broken old horse-pistols were
good enough to play at pirating with, but something
which would really shoot was needed when they
started out in earnest on a sure-enough adventure.</div>

<p>Georgina suggested that he go to Fishburn Court
and borrow a rifle that she had seen up in Uncle
Darcy's attic. She would go with him and do the
asking, she added, but Belle had promised to take
her with her the next time she went to see the net-mender,
and the next time would be the following
afternoon, if Tippy was well enough to be up and
around. Georgina couldn't miss the chance to see
inside the cottage that had been the home of a hero
and Belle's drowned lover. She wanted to see the
newspaper which Mr. Potter showed everybody who
went to the house. It had an account of the wreck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and the rescue in it, with Emmett's picture on the
front page, and black headlines under it that said,
"Died like a hero."</p>

<p>Tippy was well enough to be up next day, so
Richard went alone to Fishburn Court, and Georgina
trudged along the sandy road with Belle to the
weather-beaten cottage on the edge of the cranberry
bog. Belle told her more about the old man as they
walked along.</p>

<p>"Seems as if he just lives on that memory. He
can't get out in the boats any more, being so crippled
up, and he can't see to read much, so there's lots of
time for him to sit and think on the past. If it
wasn't for the nets he'd about lose his mind. I
wouldn't say it out, and you needn't repeat it, but
sometimes I think it's already touched a mite. You
see the two of them lived there together so long
alone, that Emmett was all in all to his father. I
suppose that's why Emmett is all he can talk about
now."</p>

<p>When they reached the cottage Mr. Potter was
sitting out in front as usual, busy with his work.
Georgina was glad that he did not offer to shake
hands. His were so dirty and black with tar she felt
she could not bear to touch them. He was a swarthy
old man with skin like wrinkled leather, and a bushy,
grizzled beard which grew up nearly to his eyes.
Again Georgina wondered, looking at Belle in her
crisp, white dress and white shoes. How could she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
care for this unkempt old creature enough to call him
Father?</p>

<p>As she followed Belle around inside the dreary
three-room cottage she wanted to ask if this would
have been her home if Emmett had not been
drowned, but she felt a delicacy about asking such
a question. She couldn't imagine Belle in such a
setting, but after she had followed her around a
while longer she realized that the house wouldn't
stay dreary with such a mistress. In almost no time
the place was put to rights, and there was a pan of
cookies ready to slip into the oven.</p>

<p>When the smell of their browning stole out to
the front door the old man left his bench and came
in to get a handful of the hot cakes. Then, just as
Belle said he would, he told Georgina all that had
happened the night of the wreck.</p>

<p>"That's the very chair he was sittin' in, when Luke
Jones come in with the word that men were needed.
He started right off with Luke soon as he could get
into his oil-skins, for 'twas stormin' to beat the band.
But he didn't go fur. Almost no time it seemed like,
he was comin' into the house agin, and he went into
that bedroom there, and shet the door behind him.
That of itself ought to 'uv made me know something
out of the usual was beginnin' to happen, for he never
done such a thing before. A few minutes later he
came out with an old rifle that him and Dan Darcy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
used to carry around in the dunes for target shootin'
and he set it right down in that corner by the chimney
jamb.</p>

<p>"'First time anybody passes this way goin' down
to Fishburn Court,' he says, 'I wish you'd send this
along to Uncle Dan'l. It's his by rights, and he'd
ought a had it long ago.'</p>

<p>"An' them was his last words to me, except as he
pulled the door to after him he called 'Good-bye Pop,
if I don't see you agin.'</p>

<p>"I don't know when he'd done such a thing before
as to say good-bye when he went out, and I've often
wondered over it sence, could he 'a had any warnin'
that something was goin' to happen to him?"</p>

<p>Georgina gazed at the picture in the newspaper
long and curiously. It had been copied from a faded
tin-type, but even making allowances for that Emmett
didn't look as she imagined a hero should, nor
did it seem possible it could be the man Belle had
talked about. She wished she hadn't seen it. It
dimmed the glamor of romance which seemed to surround
him like a halo. Hearing about him in the
magical moonlight she had pictured him as looking
as Sir Galahad. But if <i>this</i> was what he really looked
like&mdash;&mdash;Again she glanced wonderingly at Belle.
How could she care so hard for ten long years for
just an ordinary man like that?</p>

<p>When it was time to go home Belle suggested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
they walk around by Fishburn Court. It would be
out of their way, but she had heard that Aunt Elspeth
wasn't as well as usual.</p>

<p>"Emmett always called her Aunt," she explained
to Georgina as they walked along, "so I got into the
way of doing it, too. He was so fond of Dan's
mother. She was so good to him after his own went
that I feel I want to be nice to her whenever I can,
for his sake."</p>

<p>"You know," she continued, "Aunt Elspeth never
would give up but that Dan was innocent, and since
her memory's been failing her this last year, she talks
all the time about his coming home; just lies there in
bed half her time and babbles about him. It almost
kills Uncle Dan'l to hear her, because, of course, he
knows the truth of the matter, that Dan <i>was</i> guilty.
He as good as confessed it before he ran away, and
the running away itself told the story."</p>

<p>When they reached Fishburn Court they could see
two people sitting in front of the cottage. Uncle
Darcy was in an armchair on the grass with one of
the cats in his lap, and Richard sat on one seat of the
red, wooden swing with Captain Kidd on the opposite
one. Richard had a rifle across his knees, the
one Georgina had suggested borrowing. He passed
his hand caressingly along its stock now and then,
and at intervals raised it to sight along the barrel.
It was so heavy he could not keep it from wobbling
when he raised it to take aim in various directions.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>At the click of the gate-latch the old man tumbled
Yellownose out of his lap and rose stiffly to welcome
his guests.</p>

<p>"Come right in," he said cordially. "Mother'll be
glad to see you, Belle. She's been sort of low in her
mind lately, and needs cheering up."</p>

<p>He led the way into a low-ceilinged, inner bedroom
with the shades all pulled down. It was so dark,
compared to the glaring road they had been following,
that Georgina blinked at the dim interior. She
could scarcely make out the figure on the high-posted
bed, and drew back, whispering to Belle that she'd
stay outside until they were ready to go home. Leaving
them on the threshold, she went back to the shady
door-yard to a seat in the swing beside Captain
Kidd.</p>

<p>"It's Uncle Darcy's son's rifle," explained Richard.
"He's been telling me about him. Feel how
smooth the stock is."</p>

<p>Georgina reached over and passed her hand lightly
along the polished wood.</p>

<p>"He and a friend of his called Emmett Potter
used to carry it on the dunes sometimes to shoot at
a mark with. It wasn't good for much else, it's so
old. Dan got it in a trade once; traded a whole litter
of collie pups for it. Uncle Darcy says he'd forgotten
there was such a gun till somebody brought it
to him after Emmett was drowned."</p>

<p>"Oh," interrupted Georgina, her eyes wide with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
interest. "Emmett's father has just been telling me
about this very rifle. But I didn't dream it was the
one I'd seen up in the attic here. He showed me the
corner where Emmett stood it when he left for the
wreck, and told what was to be done with it. 'Them
were his last words,'" she added, quoting Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>She reached out her hand for the clumsy old firearm
and almost dropped it, finding it so much heavier
than she expected. She wanted to touch with her
own fingers the weapon that had such an interesting
history, and about which a hero had spoken his last
words.</p>

<p>"The hammer's broken," continued Richard.
"Whoever brought it home let it fall. It's all rusty,
too, because it was up in the attic so many years and
the roof leaked on it. But Uncle Darcy said lots of
museums would be glad to have it because there
aren't many of these old flint-locks left now. He's
going to leave it to the Pilgrim museum up by the
monument when he's dead and gone, but he wants to
keep it as long as he lives because Danny set such
store by it."</p>

<p>"There's some numbers or letters or something
on it," announced Georgina, peering at a small brass
plate on the stock. "I can't make them out. I tell
you what let's do," she exclaimed in a burst of enthusiasm.
"Let's polish it up so's we can read them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Tippy uses vinegar and wood ashes for brass. I'll
run get some."</p>

<p>Georgina was enough at home here to find what
she wanted without asking, and as full of resources
as Robinson Crusoe. She was back in a very few
minutes with a shovel full of ashes from the kitchen
stove, and an old can lid full of vinegar, drawn from
a jug in the corner cupboard. With a scrap of a
rag dipped first in vinegar, then in ashes, she began
scrubbing the brass plate diligently. It had corroded
until there was an edge of green entirely around it.</p>

<p>"I love to take an old thing like this and scrub
it till it shines like gold," she said, scouring away
with such evident enjoyment of the job that Richard
insisted on having a turn. She surrendered the rag
grudgingly, but continued to direct operations.</p>

<p>"Now dip it in the ashes again. No, not that way,
double the rag up and use more vinegar. Rub around
that other corner a while. Here, let me show you."</p>

<p>She took the rifle away from him again and proceeded
to illustrate her advice. Suddenly she looked
up, startled.</p>

<p>"I believe we've rubbed it loose. It moved a little
to one side. See?"</p>

<p>He grabbed it back and examined it closely. "I
bet it's meant to move," he said finally. "It looks
like a lid, see! It slides sideways."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember now," she cried, much excited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
"That's the way Leather-Stocking's rifle was made.
There was a hole in the stock with a brass plate over
it, and he kept little pieces of oiled deer-skin inside
of it to wrap bullets in before he loaded 'em in. I
remember just as plain, the place in the story where
he stopped to open it and take out a piece of oiled
deer-skin when he started to load."</p>

<p>As she explained she snatched the rifle back into
her own hands once more, and pried at the brass
plate until she broke the edge of her thumb nail.
Then Richard took it, and with the aid of a rusty
button-hook which he happened to have in his pocket,
having found it on the street that morning, he pushed
the plate entirely back.</p>

<p>"There's something white inside!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Instantly two heads bent over with his in an attempt
to see, for Captain Kidd's shaggy hair was side
by side with Georgina's curls, his curiosity as great
as hers.</p>

<p>"Whatever's in there has been there an awful long
time," said Richard as he poked at the contents with
his button-hook, "for Uncle Darcy said the rifle's
never been used since it was brought back to him."</p>

<p>"And it's ten years come Michaelmas since Emmett
was drowned," said Georgina, again quoting the
old net-mender.</p>

<p>The piece of paper which they finally succeeded in
drawing out had been folded many times and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
crumpled into a flat wad. Evidently the message on
it had been scrawled hastily in pencil by someone little
used to letter writing. It was written in an odd
hand, and the united efforts of the two little readers
could decipher only parts of it.</p>

<p>"I can read any kind of plain writing like they do
in school," said Richard, "but not this sharp-cornered
kind where the m's and u's are alike, and all the tails
are pointed."</p>

<p>Slowly they puzzled out parts of it, halting long
over some of the undecipherable words, but a few
words here and there were all they could recognize.
There were long stretches that had no meaning whatever
for them. This much, however, they managed
to spell out:</p>

<p>"Dan never took the money.... I did it....
He went away because he knew I did it and wouldn't
tell.... Sorry.... Can't stand it any longer....
Put an end to it all...."</p>

<p>It was signed "Emmett Potter."</p>

<p>The two children looked at each other with puzzled
eyes until into Georgina's came a sudden and
startled understanding. Snatching up the paper she
almost fell out of the swing and ran towards the
house screaming:</p>

<p>"Uncle Darcy! Uncle Darcy! Look what we've
found."</p>

<p>She tripped over a piece of loose carpet spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
just inside the front door as a rug and fell full length,
but too excited to know that she had skinned her
elbow she scrambled up, still calling:</p>

<p>"Uncle Darcy, <i>Dan never took the money. It was
Emmett Potter. He said so himself!</i>"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A HARD PROMISE</div>


<div class='cap'>A &nbsp; DOZEN times in Georgina's day-dreaming she
had imagined this scene. She had run to Uncle
Darcy with the proof of Dan's innocence, heard his
glad cry, seen his face fairly transfigured as he read
the confession aloud. Now it was actually happening
before her very eyes, but where was the scene
of heavenly gladness that should have followed?</div>

<p>Belle, startled even more than he by Georgina's
outcry, and quicker to act, read the message over his
shoulder, recognized the handwriting and grasped
the full significance of the situation before he reached
the name at the end. For ten years three little notes
in that same peculiar hand had lain in her box of
keepsakes. There was no mistaking that signature.
She had read it and cried over it so many times that
now as it suddenly confronted her with its familiar
twists and angles it was as startling as if Emmett's
voice had called to her.</p>

<p>As Uncle Darcy looked up from the second reading,
with a faltering exclamation of thanksgiving, she
snatched the paper from his shaking hands and tore
it in two. Then crumpling the pieces and flinging
them from her, she seized him by the wrists.</p>

<p>"No, you're <i>not</i> going to tell the whole world,"
she cried wildly, answering the announcement he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
made with the tears raining down his cheeks.
"You're not going to tell anybody! Think of me!
Think of Father Potter!"</p>

<p>She almost screamed her demand. He could
hardly believe it was Belle, this frenzied girl, who,
heretofore, had seemed the gentlest of souls. He
looked at her in a dazed way, so overwhelmed by
the discovery that had just been made, that he failed
to comprehend the reason for her white face and
agonized eyes, till she threw up her arms crying:</p>

<p>"<i>Emmett</i> a thief! God in heaven! It'll kill me!"</p>

<p>It was the sight of Georgina's shocked face with
Richard's at the door, that made things clear to the
old man. He waved them away, with hands which
shook as if he had the palsy.</p>

<p>"Go on out, children, for a little while," he said
gently, and closed the door in their faces.</p>

<p>Slowly they retreated to the swing, Georgina clasping
the skinned elbow which had begun to smart.
She climbed into one seat of the swing and Richard
and Captain Kidd took the other. As they swung
back and forth she demanded in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Why is it that grown people always shut children
out of their secrets? Seems as if we have a right to
know what's the matter when <i>we</i> found the paper."</p>

<p>Richard made no answer, for just then the sound
of Belle's crying came out to them. The windows of
the cottage were all open and the grass plot between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the windows and the swing being a narrow one the
closed door was of little avail. It was very still
there in the shady dooryard, so still that they could
hear old Yellownose purr, asleep on the cushion in
the wooden arm-chair beside the swing. The broken
sentences between the sobs were plainly audible. It
seemed so terrible to hear a grown person cry, that
Georgina felt as she did that morning long ago, when
old Jeremy's teeth flew into the fire. Her confidence
was shaken in the world. She felt there could be
no abiding happiness in anything.</p>

<p>"She's begging him not to tell," whispered Richard.</p>

<p>"But I owe it to Danny," they heard Uncle Darcy
say. And then, "Why should I spare Emmett's
father? Emmett never spared me, he never spared
Danny."</p>

<p>An indistinct murmur as if Belle's answer was
muffled in her handkerchief, then Uncle Darcy's
voice again:</p>

<p>"It isn't fair that the town should go on counting
him a hero and brand my boy as a coward, when it's
Emmett who was the coward as well as the thief."</p>

<p>Again Belle's voice in a quick cry of pain, as sharp
as if she had been struck. Then the sound of another
door shutting, and when the voices began again
it was evident they had withdrawn into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"They don't want Aunt Elspeth to hear," said
Georgina.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's it all about?" asked Richard, much mystified.</p>

<p>Georgina told him all that she knew herself, gathered
from the scraps she had heard the day of Cousin
Mehitable's visit, and from various sources since;
told him in a half whisper stopping now and then
when some fragment of a sentence floated out to them
from the kitchen; for occasional words still continued
to reach them through the windows in the rear,
when the voices rose at intervals to a higher pitch.</p>

<p>What passed behind those closed doors the children
never knew. They felt rather than understood
what was happening. Belle's pleading was beginning
to be effectual, and the old man was rising to
the same heights of self-sacrifice which Dan had
reached, when he slipped away from home with the
taint of his friend's disgrace upon him in order to
save that friend.</p>

<p>That some soul tragedy had been enacted in that
little room the children felt vaguely when Belle came
out after a while. Her eyes were red and swollen
and her face drawn and pinched looking. She did
not glance in their direction, but stood with her face
averted and hand on the gate-latch while Uncle
Darcy stopped beside the swing.</p>

<p>"Children," he said solemnly, "I want you to
promise me never to speak to anyone about finding
that note in the old rifle till I give you permission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Will you do this for me, just because I ask it, even if
I can't tell you why?"</p>

<p>"Mustn't I even tell Barby?" asked Georgina,
anxiously.</p>

<p>He hesitated, glancing uncertainly at Belle, then
answered:</p>

<p>"No, not even your mother, till I tell you that you
can. Now you see what a very important secret it is.
Can <i>you</i> keep it, son? Will you promise me too?"</p>

<p>He turned to Richard with the question. With a
finger under the boy's chin he tipped up his face and
looked into it searchingly. The serious, brown eyes
looked back into his, honest and unflinching.</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise," he answered. "Honor bright
I'll not tell."</p>

<p>The old man turned to the waiting figure at the
gate.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Belle. You needn't worry about it
any more. You can trust us."</p>

<p>She made no answer, but looking as if she had
aged years in the last half hour, she passed through
the gate and into the sandy court, moving slowly
across it towards the street beyond.</p>

<p>With a long-drawn sigh the old man sank down
on the door-step and buried his face in his hands.
They were still shaking as if he had the palsy. For
some time the children sat in embarrassed silence,
thinking every moment that he would look up and say
something. They wanted to go, but waited for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to make some movement. He seemed to have forgotten
they were there. Finally a clock inside the
cottage began striking five. It broke the spell which
bound them.</p>

<p>"Let's go," whispered Richard.</p>

<p>"All right," was the answer, also whispered.
"Wait till I take the shovel and can lid back to the
kitchen."</p>

<p>"I'll take 'em," he offered. "I want to get a drink,
anyhow."</p>

<p>Stealthily, as if playing Indian, they stepped out
of the swing and tiptoed through the grass around
the corner of the house. Even the dog went noiselessly,
instead of frisking and barking as he usually
did when starting anywhere. Their return was
equally stealthy. As they slipped through the gate
Georgina looked back at the old man. He was still
sitting on the step, his face in his hands, as if he were
bowed down by some weight too heavy for his shoulders
to bear.</p>

<p>The weary hopelessness of his attitude made her
want to run back and throw her arms around his
neck, but she did not dare. Trouble as great as that
seemed to raise a wall around itself. It could not be
comforted by a caress. The only thing to do was to
slip past and not look.</p>

<p>Richard shared the same awe, for he went away
leaving the rifle lying in the grass. Instinctively he
felt that it ought not to be played with now. It was
the rifle which had changed everything.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LOST AND FOUND AT THE LINIMENT WAGON</div>


<div class='cap'>WITH Mrs. Triplett back in bed again on account
of the rheumatism which crippled her,
and Belle going about white of face and sick of soul,
home held little cheer for Georgina. But with Mrs.
Triplett averse to company of any kind, and Belle
anxious to be alone with her misery, there was nothing
to hinder Georgina from seeking cheer elsewhere
and she sought it early and late.</div>

<p>She had spent her birthday dollar in imagination
many times before she took her check to the bank to
have it cashed. With Richard to lend her courage,
and Manuel, Joseph and Rosa trailing after by special
invitation, she walked in and asked for Mr.
Gates. That is the way Barby always did, and as far
as Georgina knew he was the only one to apply to
for money.</p>

<p>The paying teller hesitated a moment about summoning
the president of the bank from his private
office at the behest of so small a child, so small that
even on tiptoe her eyes could barely peer into the
window of his cage. But they were entreating eyes,
so big and brown and sure of their appeal that he decided
to do their bidding.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as he turned to knock at the door behind him
it opened, and Mr. Gates came out with the man
with whom he had been closeted in private conference.
It was Richard's Cousin James. The children
did not see him, however, for he stopped at one of
the high desks inside to look at some papers which
one of the clerks spread out before him.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's my little friend, Georgina," said Mr.
Gates, smiling in response to the beaming smile she
gave him. "Well, what can I do for you, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Cash my check, please," she said, pushing the
slip of paper towards him with as grand an air as if
it had been for a million dollars instead of one, "and
all in nickels, please."</p>

<p>He glanced at the name she had written painstakingly
across the back.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Huntingdon," he exclaimed gravely,
although there was a twinkle in his eyes, "if all lady
customers were as businesslike in endorsing their
checks and in knowing what they want, we bankers
would be spared a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>It was the first time that Georgina had ever been
called Miss Huntingdon, and knowing he said it to
tease her, it embarrassed her to the point of making
her stammer, when he asked her most unexpectedly
while picking out twenty shining new nickels to stuff
into the little red purse:</p>

<p>"All of these going to buy tracts for the missionaries
to take to the little heathen?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, they're all going to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She didn't like to say for soda water and chewing
gum and the movies, and hesitated till a substitute
word occurred to her.</p>

<p>"They're all going to go for buying good times.
It's for a sort of a club we made up this morning,
Richard and me."</p>

<p>"May I ask the name of the club?"</p>

<p>Georgina glanced around. No other customer
happened to be in the bank at the moment and Richard
had wandered out to the street to wait for her.
So tiptoeing a little higher she said in a low tone as
if imparting a secret:</p>

<p>"It's the <i>Rainbow</i> Club. We pretend that everytime
we make anybody happy we've made a little
rainbow in the world."</p>

<p>"Well, bless your heart," was the appreciative
answer. "You've already made one in here. You
do that every time you come around."</p>

<p>Then he looked thoughtfully at her over his spectacles.</p>

<p>"Would you take an old fellow like me into your
club?"</p>

<p>Georgina considered a moment, first stealing a
glance at him to see if he were in earnest or still trying
to tease. He seemed quite serious so she answered:</p>

<p>"If you really <i>want</i> to belong. Anybody with a
bank full of money ought to be able to make happy
times for the whole town."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any dues to pay? What are the rules and what
are the duties of a member?"</p>

<p>Again Georgina was embarrassed. He seemed to
expect so much more than she had to offer. She
swung the red purse around nervously as she answered:</p>

<p>"I guess you won't think it's much of a club.
There's nothing to it but just its name, and all we do
is just to go around making what it says."</p>

<p>"Count me as Member number Three," said Mr.
Gates gravely. "I'm proud to join you. Shake hands
on it. I'll try to be a credit to the organization, and
I hope you'll drop around once in a while and let
me know how it's getting along."</p>

<p>The beaming smile with which Georgina shook
hands came back to him all morning at intervals.</p>

<p>Cousin James Milford, who had been an interested
listener, followed her out of the bank presently and
as he drove his machine slowly past the drug-store
he saw the five children draining their glasses at the
soda-water fountain. He stopped, thinking to invite
Richard and Georgina to go to Truro with him.
It never would have occurred to him to give the three
little Portuguese children a ride also had he not
overheard that conversation in the bank.</p>

<p>"Well, why not?" he asked himself, smiling inwardly.
"It might as well be rainbows for the crowd
while I'm about it."</p>

<p>So for the first time in their lives Manuel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Joseph and Rosa rode in one of the "honk wagons"
which heretofore they had known only as something
to be dodged when one walked abroad. Judging
by the blissful grins which took permanent lodging
on their dirty faces, Cousin James was eligible to
the highest position the new club could bestow, if
ever he should apply for membership.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Triplett had been downstairs that evening,
none of the birthday nickels would have found
their way through the ticket window of the moving
picture show. She supposed that Georgina was
reading as usual beside the evening lamp, or was
out on the front porch talking to Belle. But Belle,
not caring to talk to anyone, had given instant consent
when Georgina, who wanted to go to the show,
having seen wonderful posters advertising it, suggested
that Mrs. Fayal would take her in charge.
She did not add that she had already seen Mrs. Fayal
and promised to provide tickets for her and the
children in case she could get permission from home.
Belle did not seem interested in hearing such things,
so Georgina hurried off lest something might happen
to interfere before she was beyond the reach of
summoning voices.</p>

<p>On the return from Truro she had asked to be
put out at the Fayal cottage, having it in mind to
make some such arrangement. Manuel had seen one
show, but Joseph and Rosa had never so much as
had their heads inside of one. She found Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Fayal glooming over a wash-tub, not because she
objected to washing for the summer people. She
was used to that, having done it six days out of
seven every summer since she had married Joe
Fayal. What she was glooming over was that Joe
was home from a week's fishing trip with his share
of the money for the biggest catch of the season, and
not a dime of it had she seen. It had all gone into
the pocket of an itinerant vendor, and Joe was
lying in a sodden stupor out under the grape arbor
at the side of the cottage.</p>

<p>Georgina started to back away when she found the
state of affairs. She did not suppose Mrs. Fayal
would have a mind for merry-making under the circumstances.
But, indeed, Mrs. Fayal did.</p>

<p>"All the more reason that I should go off and forget
my troubles and have a good time for a while,"
she said decidedly. Georgina recognized the spirit
if not the words of her own "line to live by." Mrs.
Fayal could bear up and steer onward with a joyful
heart any time she had the price of admission to a
movie in her pocket. So feeling that as a member
of the new club she could not have a better opportunity
to make good its name, Georgina promised
the tickets for the family even if she could not go
herself. She would send them by Richard if not
allowed to take them in person.</p>

<p>It was still light when Georgina fared forth at the
end of the long summer day. Richard joined her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
at the foot of the Green Stairs with the price of his
own ticket in his pocket, and Captain Kidd tagging
at his heels.</p>

<p>"They won't let the dog into the show," Georgina
reminded him.</p>

<p>"That's so, and he might get into a fight or run
over if I left him outside," Richard answered.
"B'leeve I'll shut him up in the garage."</p>

<p>This he did, fastening the door securely, and returning
in time to see the rest of the party turning
the corner, and coming towards the Green Stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fayal, after her long day over the wash-tub,
was resplendent in lavender shirt-waist, blue
serge skirt and white tennis shoes, with long gold
ear-rings dangling half-way to her shoulders. Manuel
and Joseph were barefooted as usual, and in overalls
as usual, but their lack of gala attire was made
up for by Rosa's. No wax doll was ever more
daintily and lacily dressed. Georgina looked at her
in surprise, wishing Tippy could see her now. Rosa
in her white dress and slippers and with her face
clean, was a little beauty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fayal made a delightful chaperon. She
was just as ready as anyone in her train to stop in
front of shop windows, to straggle slowly down the
middle of the street, or to thrust her hand into Richard's
bag of peanuts whenever he passed it around.
Cracking shells and munching the nuts, they strolled
along with a sense of freedom which thrilled Georgina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to the core. She had never felt it before. She
had just bought five tickets and Richard his one, and
they were about to pass in although Mrs. Fayal said
it was early yet, when a deep voice roaring through
the crowd attracted their attention. It was as sonorous
as a megaphone.</p>

<p>"Walk up, ladies and gentlemen. See the wild-cat,
<i>Texas Tim</i>, brought from the banks of the
Brazos."</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Richard and Georgina in the
same breath. Mrs. Fayal, out for a good time and
to see all that was to be seen, bobbed her long ear-rings
in gracious assent, and headed the procession,
in order that her ample form might make an entering
wedge for the others, as she elbowed her way
through the crowd gathered at the street end of
Railroad wharf.</p>

<p>It clustered thickest around a wagon in which
stood a broad-shouldered man, mounted on a chair.
He wore a cow-boy hat. A flaming torch set up beside
the wagon lighted a cage in one end of it, in
which crouched a wild-cat bewildered by the light
and the bedlam of noisy, pushing human beings. The
children could not see the animal at first, but pushed
nearer the wagon to hear what the man was saying.
He held up a bottle and shook it over the heads of
the people.</p>

<p>"Here's your marvelous rheumatism remedy," he
cried, "made from the fat of wild-cats. Warranted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to cure every kind of ache, sprain and misery known
to man. Only fifty cents, ladies and gentlemen, sure
cure or your money back. Anybody here with an
ache or a pain?"</p>

<p>The children pushed closer. Richard, feeling the
effect of the gun-powder he had eaten, turned to
Georgina.</p>

<p>"I dare you to climb up and touch the end of the
wild-cat's tail."</p>

<p>Georgina stood on tiptoe, then dodged under
someone's elbow for a nearer view. The end of
the tail protruded from between the bars of the cage,
in easy reach if one were on the wagon, but those furtive
eyes keeping watch above it were savage in
their gleaming. Then she, too, remembered the gun-powder.</p>

<p>"I'll do it if you will."</p>

<p>Before Richard could put the gun-powder to the
test the man reached down for a guitar leaning
against his chair, and with a twanging of chords
which made the shifting people on the outskirts stand
still to see what would happen next, he began to sing
a song that had been popular in his youth. Or,
rather, it was a parody of the song. Georgina recognized
it as one that she had heard Uncle Darcy
sing, and even Tippy hummed it sometimes when
she was sewing. It was, "When you and I were
young, Maggie."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>They say we are aged and gray, Maggie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As spray by the white breakers flung,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the liniment keeps us as spry, Maggie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As when you and I were young."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>Several people laughed and passed on when the
song was done, but the greater part of the crowd
stayed, hoping to hear another, for the voice was a
powerful one and fairly sweet.</p>

<p>"Anybody here with any aches or pains?" he called
again. "If so, step this way, please, and let me make
a simple demonstration of how quickly this magic
oil will cure you."</p>

<p>There was a commotion near the wagon, and a
man pushed his way through and climbed up on the
wheel. He offered a stiff wrist for treatment. The
vendor tipped up the bottle and poured out some
pungent volatile oil from the bottle, the odor of
which was far-reaching. He rubbed the wrist briskly
for a moment, then gave it a slap saying, "Now see
what you can do with it, my friend."</p>

<p>The patient scowled at it, twisting his arm in every
possible direction as if skeptical of any help from
such a source, but gradually letting a look of pleased
surprise spread across his face. The crowd watched
in amusement, and nearly everybody laughed when
the patient finally announced in a loud voice that he
was cured, that it was nothing short of a miracle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and that he'd buy half a dozen bottles of that witch
stuff to take home to his friends.</p>

<p>The vendor began his speech-making again, calling
attention to the cure they had just witnessed, and
urging others to follow. As the subject of the cure
stepped down from the wheel Richard sprang up
in his place. Georgina, pressing closer, saw him
lean over the side of the wagon and boldly take hold
of the end of the beast's tail.</p>

<p>"There. I did it," he announced. "Now it's your
turn."</p>

<p>Georgina gave one glance at the wild-cat's eyes
and drew back. They seemed to glare directly at
her. She wondered how strong the bars were, and
if they would hold the beast in case it rose up in a
rage and sprang at her. But Richard was waiting,
and she clambered up on the hub of the wheel. Luckily
its owner was turned towards the other side at
that moment or she might have been ordered down.</p>

<p>"There! I did it, too," she announced an instant
later. "Now you can't crow over me."</p>

<p>She was about to step down when she saw in the
other end of the wagon, something she had not
been able to see from her place on the ground under
the elbows of the crowd. In a low rocking chair sat
an elderly woman, oddly out of place in this traveling
medicine show as far as appearance was concerned.
She had a calm, motherly face, gray hair
combed smoothly down over her ears, a plain old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
gray dress and an air of being perfectly at
home. It was the serene, unconscious manner one
would have in sitting on the door-step at home. She
did not seem to belong in the midst of this seething
curious mass, or to realize that she was a part of the
show. She smiled now at Georgina in such a friendly
way that Georgina smiled back and continued to
stand on the wheel. She hoped that this nice old
lady would say something about the virtues of the
medicine, for it cured two more people, even while
she looked, and if she could be sure it did all that
was claimed for it she would spend all the rest of
her birthday money in buying a bottle for Tippy.</p>

<p>The placid old lady said nothing, but her reassuring
presence finally made Georgina decide to buy
the bottle, and she emptied the red purse of everything
except the tickets. Then the man embarrassed
her until her cheeks flamed.</p>

<p>"That's right, little girl. Carry it to the dear
sufferer at home who will bless you for your kindness.
Anybody else here who will imitate this child's
generous act? If you haven't any pain yourself,
show your gratitude by thinking of someone less
fortunate than you."</p>

<p>Georgina felt that her blushes were burning her
up at thus being made the centre of public notice.
She almost fell off the wheel in her haste to get down,
and in doing so stumbled over a dog which suddenly
emerged from under the wagon at that instant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it's Captain Kidd!" she exclaimed in astonishment.
"How ever did he get here?"</p>

<p>"Must have scratched under the door and trailed
us," answered Richard. "Go on home, sir!" he commanded,
sternly, stamping his foot. "You know they
won't let you into the show with us, and you'll get
into trouble if you stay downtown alone. Go on
home I say."</p>

<p>With drooping tail and a look so reproachful that
it was fairly human, Captain Kidd slunk away, starting
mournfully homeward. He sneaked back in a
few minutes, however, and trailed his party as far
as the door of the theatre. Somebody kicked at him
and he fled down the street again, retracing the trail
that had led him to the wagon.</p>

<p>A long time after when the performance was
nearly over he went swinging up the beach with
something in his mouth which he had picked up from
near the end of the wagon. It was a tobacco pouch
of soft gray leather that had never been used for
tobacco. There was something hard and round inside
which felt like a bone. At the top of the Green
Stairs he lay down and mouthed it a while, tugging
at it with his sharp teeth; but after he had mumbled
and gnawed it for some time without bringing the
bone any nearer the surface, he grew tired of his
newfound plaything. Dropping it in the grass,
he betook himself to the door-mat on the front
porch, to await his master's return.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BURIED TREASURE</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN Georgina tiptoed up the walk to the
front porch where Belle sat waiting for her
in the moonlight, Tippy called down that she wasn't
asleep, and they needn't stay out there on her account,
whispering. It did not seem an auspicious
time to present the bottle of liniment, but to Georgina's
surprise Tippy seemed glad to try the new
remedy. The long-continued pain which refused to
yield to treatment made her willing to try anything
which promised relief.</div>

<p>It was vile-smelling stuff, so pungent that whenever
the cork was taken out of the bottle the whole
house knew it, but it burned with soothing fire and
Tippy rose up and called it blessed before the next
day was over. Before that happened, however,
Georgina took advantage of Belle's easy rule to
leave home as soon as her little morning tasks were
done. Strolling down the board-walk with many
stops she came at last to the foot of the Green
Stairs. Richard sat on the top step, tugging at a
knotted string.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on up," he called. "See what I've taken
away from Captain Kidd. He was just starting to
bury it. Looks like a tobacco pouch, but I haven't
got it untied yet. He made the string all wet, gnawing
on it."</p>

<p>Georgina climbed to the top of the steps and sat
down beside him, watching in deep and silent interest.
When the string finally gave way she offered her lap
to receive the contents of the pouch. Two five-dollar
gold pieces rolled out first, then a handful of small
change, a black ring evidently whittled out of a rubber
button and lastly a watch-fob ornament. It was
a little compass, set in something which looked like
a nut.</p>

<p>"I believe that's a buckeye," said Richard. He
examined it carefully on all sides, then called excitedly:</p>

<p>"Aw, look here! See those letters scratched on
the side&mdash;'D. D.'? That stands for <i>my</i> name, Dare-devil
Dick. I'm going to keep it."</p>

<p>"That's the cunningest thing I ever saw," declared
Georgina in a tone both admiring and envious, which
plainly showed that she wished the initials were such
as could be claimed by a Gory George. Then she
picked up the pouch and thrust in her hand. Something
rustled. It was a letter. Evidently it had
been forwarded many times, for the envelope was
entirely criss-crossed with names that had been written
and blotted out that new ones might be added.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
All they could make out was "Mrs. Henry"&mdash;"Texas"
and "Mass."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have that stamp for my album," said
Richard. "It's foreign. Seems to me I've got one
that looks something like it, but I'm not sure. Maybe
the letter will tell who the pouch belongs to."</p>

<p>"But we can't read other people's letters," objected
Georgina.</p>

<p>"Well, who wants to? It won't be reading it just
to look at the head and tail, will it?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Georgina, hesitatingly. "Though
it does seem like peeking."</p>

<p>"Well, if you lost something wouldn't you rather
whoever found it should peek and find out it was
yours, than to have it stay lost forever?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I s'pose so."</p>

<p>"Let's look, then."</p>

<p>Two heads bent over the sheet spread out on
Richard's knee. They read slowly in unison, "Dear
friend," then turned over the paper and sought the
last line. "Your grateful friend Dave."</p>

<p>"We don't know any more now than we did before,"
said Georgina, virtuously folding up the letter
and slipping it back into the envelope.</p>

<p>"Let's take it to Uncle Darcy. Then he'll let us
go along and ring the bell when he calls, 'Found.'"</p>

<p>Richard had two objections to this. "Who'd pay
him for doing it? Besides, it's gold money, and anybody
who loses that much would advertise for it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the papers. Let's keep it till this week's papers come
out, and then we'll have the fun of taking it to the
person who lost it."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be safe for us to keep it," was Georgina's
next objection. "It's gold money and burglars
might find out we had it."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you"&mdash;&mdash;Richard's face shone as
he made the suggestion&mdash;"Let's <i>bury</i> it. That will
keep it safe till we can find the owner, and when we
dig it up we can play it's pirate gold and it'll be like
finding real treasure."</p>

<p>"Lets!" agreed Georgina. "We can keep out
something, a nickel or a dime, and when we go to dig
up the pouch we can throw it over toward the place
where we buried the bag and say, 'Brother, go find
your brother,' the way Tom Sawyer did. Then we'll
be certain to hit the spot."</p>

<p>Richard picked up the compass, and rubbed the
polished sides of the nut in which it was set.</p>

<p>"I'll keep this out instead of a nickel. I wonder
what the fellow's name was that this D. D. stands
for?"</p>

<p>Half an hour later two bloody-minded sea-robbers
slipped through the back gate of the Milford place
and took their stealthy way out into the dunes. No
fierce mustachios or hoop ear-rings marked them on
this occasion as the Dread Destroyer or the Menace
of the Main. The time did not seem favorable for
donning their real costumes. So one went disguised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
as a dainty maiden in a short pink frock and long
brown curls, and the other as a sturdy boy in a grass-stained
linen suit with a hole in the knee of his stocking.
But their speech would have betrayed their evil
business had anyone been in earshot of it. One
would have thought it was</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Wild Roger come again.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>He spoke of forays and of frays upon the Spanish Main.</i>"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Having real gold to bury made the whole affair
seem a real adventure. They were recounting to
each other as they dug, the bloody fight it had taken
to secure this lot of treasure.</p>

<p>Down in a hollow where the surrounding sand-ridges
sheltered them from view, they crouched over
a small basket they had brought with them and performed
certain ceremonies. First the pouch was
wrapped in many sheets of tin foil, which Richard
had been long in collecting from various tobacco-loving
friends. When that was done it flashed in the
sun like a nugget of wrinkled silver. This was
stuffed into a baking-powder can from which the label
had been carefully scraped, and on whose lid had
been scratched with a nail, the names Georgina Huntingdon
and Richard Moreland, with the date.</p>

<p>"We'd better put our everyday names on it instead
of our pirate names," Gory George suggested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
"For if anything should happen that some other
pirate dug it up first they wouldn't know who the
Dread Destroyer and the Menace of the Main
were."</p>

<p>Lastly, from the basket was taken the end of a
wax candle, several matches and a stick of red sealing-wax,
borrowed from Cousin James' desk.
Holding the end of the sealing-wax over the lighted
candle until it was soft and dripping, Richard daubed
it around the edge of the can lid, as he had seen the
man in the express office seal packages. He had
always longed to try it himself. There was something
peculiarly pleasing in the smell of melted sealing-wax.
Georgina found it equally alluring. She
took the stick away from him when it was about half
used, and finished it.</p>

<p>"There won't be any to put back in Cousin James'
desk if you keep on using it," he warned her.</p>

<p>"I'm not using any more than you did," she answered,
and calmly proceeded to smear on the remainder.
"If you had let me seal with the first end
of the stick, you'd have had all the last end to save."</p>

<p>All this time Captain Kidd sat close beside them,
an interested spectator, but as they began digging
the hole he rushed towards it and pawed violently
at each shovelful of sand thrown out.</p>

<p>"Aw, let him help!" Richard exclaimed when
Georgina ordered him to stop. "He ought to have
a part in it because he found the pouch and was starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to bury it his own self when I took it away from
him and spoiled his fun."</p>

<p>Georgina saw the justice of the claim and allowed
Captain Kidd to join in as he pleased, but no sooner
did they stop digging to give him a chance than he
stopped also.</p>

<p>"Rats!" called Richard in a shrill whisper.</p>

<p>At that familiar word the dog began digging so
frantically that the sand flew in every direction.
Each time he paused for breath Richard called
"Rats" again. It doubled the interest for both children
to have the dog take such frantic and earnest
part in their game.</p>

<p>When the hole was pronounced deep enough the
can was dropped in, the sand shoveled over it and
tramped down, and a marker made. A long, forked
stick, broken from a bayberry bush, was run into the
ground so that only the fork of it was visible. Then
at twenty paces from the stick, Richard stepping them
off in four directions, consulting the little compass
in so doing, Georgina placed the markers, four sections
of a broken crock rescued from the ash-barrel
and brought down in the basket for that especial
purpose.</p>

<p>"We'll let it stay buried for a week," said Richard
when all was done. "Unless somebody claims it
sooner. If they don't come in a week, then we'll
know they're never coming, and the gold will be
ours."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A NARROW ESCAPE</div>


<div class='cap'>MR. MILFORD was stretched out in a hammock
on the front porch of the bungalow when the
children came back from the dunes with their empty
basket. They could not see him as they climbed up
the terrace, the porch being high above them and
draped with vines; and he deep in a new book was
only vaguely conscious of approaching voices.</div>

<p>They were discussing the "Rescues of Rosalind,"
the play they had seen the night before on the films.
Their shrill, eager tones would have attracted the
attention of anyone less absorbed than Mr. Milford.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you couldn't," Georgina was saying. "If
you were gagged and bound the way Rosalind was,
you <i>couldn't</i> get loose, no matter how you squirmed
and twisted."</p>

<p>"Come back in the garage and try me," Richard
retorted. "I'll prove it to you that I can."</p>

<p>"<i>Always</i> an automobile dashes up and there's a
chase. It's been that way in every movie I ever
saw," announced Georgina with the air of one who
has attended nightly through many seasons.</p>

<p>"I can do that part all right," declared Richard.
"I can run an automobile."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no disputing that fact, no matter how
contradictory Georgina's frame of mind. Only the
day before she had seen him take the wheel and run
the car for three miles under the direction of Cousin
James, when they came to a level stretch of road.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you know your Cousin James said you
were never to do it unless he was along himself. You
wasn't to dare to touch it when you were out with
only the chauffeur."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't care if we got in and didn't start
anything but the engine," said Richard. "Climb in
and play that I'm running away with you. With
the motor chugging away and shaking the machine
it'll seem as if we're really going."</p>

<p>By this time they were inside the garage, with the
doors closed behind them.</p>

<p>"Now you get in and keep looking back the way
Rosalind did to see how near they are to catching
us."</p>

<p>Instantly Georgina threw herself into the spirit
of the game. Climbing into the back seat she assumed
the pose of the kidnapped bride whose adventures
had thrilled them the night before.</p>

<p>"Play my white veil is floating out in the wind,"
she commanded, "and I'm looking back and waving
to my husband to come faster and take me away from
the dreadful villain who is going to kill me for my
jewels. I wish this car was out of doors instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in this dark garage. When I look back I look bang
against the closed door every time, and I can't make
it seem as if I was seeing far down the road."</p>

<p>"Play it's night," suggested Richard. He had put
on a pair of goggles and was making a great pretence
of getting ready to start. Georgina, leaning
out as Rosalind had done, waved her lily hand in
frantic beckonings for her rescuers to follow faster.
The motor chugged harder and harder. The car
shook violently.</p>

<p>To the vivid imaginations of the passengers, the
chase was as exciting as if the automobile were really
plunging down the road instead of throbbing steadily
in one spot in the dim garage. The gas rolling up
from somewhere in the back made it wonderfully
realistic. But out on the open road the smell of
burning gasoline would not have been so overpowering.
Inside the little box-like garage it began to
close in on them and settle down like a dense fog.</p>

<p>Georgina coughed and Richard looked back apprehensively,
feeling that something was wrong, and
if that queer smoke didn't stop pouring out in such
a thick cloud he'd have to shut off the engine or do
something. Another moment passed and he leaned
forward, fumbling for the key, but he couldn't find
it. He had grown queerly confused and light-headed.
He couldn't make his fingers move where
he wanted them to go.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked back at Georgina. She wasn't waving
her hands any more. She was lying limply back on
the seat as if too tired to play any longer. And a
thousand miles away&mdash;at least it sounded that far&mdash;above
the terrific noise the motor was making, he
heard Captain Kidd barking. They were short, excited
barks, so thin and queer, almost as thin and
queer as if he were barking with the voice of a
mosquito instead of his own.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;Richard heard nothing more, not even
the noise of the motor. His hand dropped from the
wheel, and he began slipping down, down from the
seat to the floor of the car, white and limp, overcome
like Georgina, by the fumes of the poisonous
gas rolling up from the carburetor.</p>

<p>Mr. Milford, up in the hammock, had been
vaguely conscious for several minutes of unusual
sounds somewhere in the neighborhood, but it was
not until he reached the end of the chapter that he
took any intelligent notice. Then he looked up thinking
somebody's machine was making a terrible fuss
somewhere near. But it wasn't that sound which
made him sit up in the hammock. It was Captain
Kidd's frantic barking and yelping and whining as if
something terrible was happening to him.</p>

<p>Standing up to stretch himself, then walking to the
corner of the porch, Mr. Milford looked out. He
could see the little terrier alternately scratching on
the garage door and making frantic efforts to dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
under it. Evidently he felt left out and was trying
desperately to join his little playmates, or else he felt
that something was wrong inside.</p>

<p>Then it came to Mr. Milford in a flash that something
<i>was</i> wrong inside. Nobody ever touched that
machine but himself and the chauffeur, and the
chauffeur, who was having a day off, was half-way to
Yarmouth by this time. He didn't wait to go down
by the steps. With one leap he was over the railing,
crashing through the vines, and running down the
terrace to the garage.</p>

<p>As he rolled back one of the sliding doors a suffocating
burst of gas rushed into his face. He pushed
both doors open wide, and with a hand over his
mouth and nose hurried through the heavily-charged
atmosphere to shut off the motor. The fresh air
rushing in, began clearing away the fumes, and he
seized Georgina and carried her out, thinking she
would be revived by the time he was back with Richard.
But neither child stirred from the grass where
he stretched them out.</p>

<p>As he called for the cook and the housekeeper,
there flashed into his mind an account he had read
recently in a New York paper, of a man and his wife
who had been asphyxiated in just such a way as this.
Now thoroughly alarmed, he sent the cook running
down the Green Stairs to summon Richard's father
from the studio, and the housekeeper to telephone in
various directions. Three doctors were there in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
miraculously short time, but despite all they could do
at the end of half an hour both little figures still lay
white and motionless.</p>

<p>Then the pulmotor that had been frantically telephoned
for arrived from the life-saving station, and
just as the man dashed up with that, Mrs. Triplett
staggered up the terrace, her knees shaking so that
she could scarcely manage to climb the last few
steps.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the happenings of the day were very
hazy in Georgina's mind. She had an indistinct
recollection of being lifted in somebody's arms and
moved about, and of feeling very sick and weak.
Somebody said soothingly to somebody who was crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, the worst is over now. They're both beginning
to come around."</p>

<p>Then she was in her own bed and the wild-cat from
the banks of the Brazos was bending over her. At
least, she thought it was the wild-cat, because she
smelled the liniment as strongly as she did when
she climbed up in the wagon beside it. But when she
opened her eyes it was Tippy who was bending over
her, smoothing her curls in a comforting, purry way,
but the smell of liniment still hung in the air.</p>

<p>Then Georgina remembered something that must
have happened before she was carried home from
the bungalow.&mdash;Captain Kidd squirming out of Tippy's
arms, and Tippy with the tears streaming down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
her face trying to hold him and hug him as if he had
been a person, and the Milford's cook saying: "If
it hadn't been for the little beast's barkin' they'd have
been dead in a few minutes more. Then there'd
have been a double funeral, poor lambs."</p>

<p>Georgina smiled drowsily now and slipped off
to sleep again, but later when she awakened the
charm of the cook's phrase aroused her thoroughly,
and she lay wondering what "a double funeral" was
like. Would it have been at her house or Richard's?
Would two little white coffins have stood side by side,
or would each have been in its own place, with the
two solemn processions meeting and joining at the
foot of the Green Stairs. Maybe they would have
put on her tombstone, "None knew her but to love
her." No, that couldn't be said about her. She'd
been wilfully disobedient too often for that, like the
time she played with the Portuguese children on purpose
to spite Tippy. She was sorry for that disobedience
now, for she had discovered that Tippy
was fonder of her than she had supposed. She had
proved it by hugging Captain Kidd so gratefully
for saving their lives, when she simply <i>loathed</i> dogs.</p>

<p>Somehow Georgina felt that she was better acquainted
with Mrs. Triplett than she had ever been
before, and fonder of her. Lying there in the dark
she made several good resolutions. She was going
to be a better girl in the future. She was going to do
kind, lovely things for everybody, so that if an early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
tomb should claim her, every heart in town would be
saddened by her going. It would be lovely to leave
a widespread heartache behind her. She wished she
could live such a life that there wouldn't be a dry eye
in the town when it was whispered from house to
house that little Georgina Huntingdon was with the
angels.</p>

<p>She pictured Belle's grief, and Uncle Darcy's and
Richard's. She had already seen Tippy's. But it
was a very different thing when she thought of Barby.
There was no pleasure in imagining Barby's grief.
There was something too real and sharp in the pain
which darted into her own heart at the thought of
it. She wanted to put her arms around her mother
and ward off sorrow and trouble from her and keep
all tears away from those dear eyes. She wanted to
grow up and take care of her darling Barby and protect
her from the Tishbite.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to Georgina that in this escape
she had been kept from the power of that mysterious
evil which had threatened her ever since she
called it forth by doing such a wicked thing as to
use the "Sacred Book" to work a charm.</p>

<p>She had been put to bed in the daytime, hence her
evening petitions were still unsaid. Now she pulled
the covers over her head and included them all in one
fervent appeal:</p>

<p>"And keep on delivering us from the Tishbite,
forever and ever, Amen!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHAT THE STORM DID</div>


<div class='cap'>NEXT morning nearly everyone in the town was
talking about the storm. Belle said what with
the booming of the waves against the breakwater
and the wind rattling the shutters, she hadn't slept a
wink all night. It seemed as if every gust would
surely take the house off its foundations.</div>

<p>Old Jeremy reported that it was one of the worst
wind-storms ever known along the Cape, wild enough
to blow all the sand dunes into the sea. They'd had
the best shaking up and shifting around that they'd
had in years, he declared. Captain Ames' cranberry
bog was buried so deep in sand you couldn't see a
blossom or a leaf. And there was sand drifted all
over the garden. It had whirled clear over the wall,
till the bird pool was half full of it.</p>

<p>Georgina listened languidly, feeling very comfortable
and important with her breakfast brought in
to her on a tray. Tippy thought it was too chilly
for her in the dining-room where there was no fire.
Jeremy had kindled a cheerful blaze on the living-room
hearth and his tales of damage done to the
shipping and to roofs and chimneys about town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
seemed to emphasize her own safety and comfort.
The only thing which made the storm seem a personal
affair was the big limb blown off the willow tree.</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett and Jeremy could remember a storm
years ago which shifted the sand until the whole face
of the Cape seemed changed. That was before the
Government planted grass all over it, to bind it together
with firm roots. Later when the ring of an
axe told that the willow limb was being chopped in
pieces, Georgina begged to be allowed to go outdoors.</p>

<p>"Let me go out and see the tracks of the storm,"
she urged. "I feel all right. I'm all over the gas
now."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Triplett preferred to run no risks. All
she said to Georgina was:</p>

<p>"No, after such a close call as you had yesterday
you stay right here where I can keep an eye on you,
and take it quietly for a day or two," but when she
went into the next room Georgina heard her say to
Belle:</p>

<p>"There's no knowing how that gas may have affected
her heart."</p>

<p>Georgina made a face at the first speech, but the
second one made her lie down languidly on the sofa
with her finger on her pulse. She was half persuaded
that there was something wrong with the way it beat,
and was about to ask faintly if she couldn't have a
little blackberry cordial with her lunch, when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
heard Richard's alley call outside and Captain Kidd's
quick bark.</p>

<p>She started up, forgetting all about the cordial and
her pulse, and was skipping to the front door when
Tippy hurried in from the dining-room and reached
it first. She had a piece of an old coffee sack in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Here!" she said abruptly to Richard, who was
so surprised at the sudden opening of the door that
he nearly fell in against her.</p>

<p>"You catch that dog and hold him while I wipe his
feet. I can't have any dirty quadruped like that,
tracking up my clean floors."</p>

<p>Georgina looked at the performance in amazement.
Tippy scrubbing away at Captain Kidd's
muddy paws till all four of them were clean, and
then actually letting him come into the house and
curl up on the hearth! Tippy, who never touched
dogs except with the end of a broom! She could
scarcely believe what her own eyes told her. She and
Richard must have had a "close call," indeed, closer
than either of them realized, to make such a wonderful
change in Tippy.</p>

<p>And the change was towards Richard, too. She
had never seemed to like him much better than his
dog. She blamed him for taking the cream bottles
when they played pirate, and she thought it made
little girls boisterous and rude to play with boys, and
she wondered at Barby's letting Georgina play with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
him. Several times she had done her wondering
out loud, so that Georgina heard her, and wanted
to say things back&mdash;shocking things, such as Rosa
said to Joseph. But she never said them. There
was always that old silver porringer, sitting prim and
lady-like upon the sideboard.</p>

<p>Things were different to-day. After the dog's
paws were wiped dry Tippy asked Richard how he
felt after the accident, and she asked it as if she really
cared and wanted to know. And she brought in a
plate of early summer apples, the first in the market,
and told him to help himself and put some in his
pocket. And there was the checker-board if they
wanted to play checkers or dominoes. Her unusual
concern for their entertainment impressed Georgina
more than anything else she could have done with the
seriousness of the danger they had been in. She felt
very solemn and important, and thanked Tippy with
a sweet, patient air, befitting one who has just been
brought up from the "valley of the shadow."</p>

<p>The moment they were alone Richard began
breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Say. On the way here I went by that place where
we buried the pouch, and what do you think? The
markers are out of sight and the whole place itself
is buried&mdash;just filled up level. What are we going
to do about it?"</p>

<p>The seriousness of the situation did not impress
Georgina until he added, "S'pose the person who lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
it comes back for it? Maybe we'd be put in prison."</p>

<p>"But nobody knows it's buried except you and me."</p>

<p>Richard scuffed one shoe against the other and
looked into the fire.</p>

<p>"But Aunt Letty says there's no getting around
it, 'Be sure your sin will find you out,' always. And
I'm awfully unlucky that way. Seems to me I never
did anything in my life that I oughtn't to a done, that
I didn't get found out. Aunt Letty has a book that
she reads to me sometimes when I'm going to bed,
that proves it. Every story in it proves it. One is
about a traveler who murdered a man, and kept it
secret for twenty years. Then he gave it away, talking
in his sleep. And one was a feather in a boy's
coat pocket. It led to its being found out that he was
a chicken thief. There's about forty such stories,
and everyone of them prove your sin is sure to find
you out some time before you die, even if you cover
it up for years and years."</p>

<p>"But we didn't do any sin," protested Georgina.
"We just buried a pouch that the dog found, to keep
it safe, and if a big wind came along and covered
it up so we can't find it, that isn't our fault. We
didn't make the wind blow, did we?"</p>

<p>"But there was gold money in that pouch," insisted
Richard, "and it wasn't ours, and maybe the
letter was important and we ought to have turned it
over to Dad or Uncle Darcy or the police or somebody."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Letty's bedtime efforts to keep Richard's
conscience tender were far more effective than she
had dreamed. He was quoting Aunt Letty now.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't want anybody to do <i>our</i> things that
way." Then a thought of his own came to him,
"You wouldn't want the police coming round and
taking you off to the lockup, would you? I saw 'em
take Binney Rogers one time, just because he broke
a window that he didn't mean to. He was only shying
a rock at a sparrow. There was a cop on each
side of him a hold of his arm, and Binney's mother
and sister were following along behind crying and
begging them not to take him something awful. But
all they could say didn't do a speck of good."</p>

<p>The picture carried weight. In spite of her light
tone Georgina was impressed, but she said defiantly:</p>

<p>"Well, nobody saw us do it."</p>

<p>"You don't know," was the gloomy answer.
"Somebody might have been up in the monument
with a spy glass, looking down. There's always
people up there spying around, or out on the masts in
the harbor, and if some sleuth was put on the trail
of that pouch the first thing that would happen would
be he'd come across the very person with the glass.
It always happens that way, and I know, because
Binney Rogers has read almost all the detective
stories there is, and he said so."</p>

<p>A feeling of uneasiness began to clutch at Georgina's
interior. Richard spoke so knowingly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
convincingly that she felt a real need for blackberry
cordial. But she said with a defiant little uplift of
her chin:</p>

<p>"Well, as long as we didn't mean to do anything
wrong, I'm not going to get scared about it. I'm
just going to bear up and steer right on, and keep
hoping that everything will turn out all right so hard
that it will."</p>

<p>Her "line to live by" buoyed her up so successfully
for the time being, that Richard, too, felt the
cheerful influence of it, and passed to more cheerful
subjects.</p>

<p>"We're going to be in all the papers," he announced.
"A reporter called up from Boston to ask
Cousin James how it happened. There's only been
a few cases like ours in the whole United States.
Won't you feel funny to see your name in the paper?
Captain Kidd will have his name in, too. I heard
Cousin James say over the telephone that he was
the hero of the hour; that if he hadn't given the
alarm we wouldn't have been discovered till it was
too late."</p>

<p>Richard did not stay long. The finished portrait
was to be hung in the Art gallery in the Town Hall
that morning and he wanted to be on hand at the
hanging. Later it would be sent to the New York
exhibition.</p>

<p>"Daddy's going to let me go with him when Mr.
Locke comes for him on his yacht. He's going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
take me because I sat still and let him get such a good
picture. It's the best he's ever done. We'll be
gone a week."</p>

<p>"When are you going?" demanded Georgina.</p>

<p>"Oh, in a few days, whenever Mr. Locke comes."</p>

<p>"I hope we can find that pouch first," she answered.
Already she was beginning to feel little and
forlorn and left behind. "It'll be awful lonesome
with you and Barby both gone."</p>

<p>Tippy came in soon after Richard left and sat
down at the secretary.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking I ought to write to your
mother and let her know about yesterday's performance
before she has a chance to hear it from outsiders
or the papers. It's a whole week to-day since she
left."</p>

<p>"A week," echoed Georgina. "Is that all? It
seems a month at least. It's been so long."</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett tossed her a calendar from the desk.</p>

<p>"Count it up for yourself," she said. "She left
two days before your birthday and this is the Wednesday
after."</p>

<p>While Mrs. Triplett began her letter Georgina
studied the calendar, putting her finger on a date as
she recalled the various happenings of it. Each day
had been long and full. That one afternoon when
she and Richard found the paper in the rifle seemed
an age in itself. It seemed months since they had
promised Belle and Uncle Darcy to keep the secret.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>She glanced up, about to say so, then bit her
tongue, startled at having so nearly betrayed the fact
of their having a secret. Then the thought came to
her that Emmett's sin had found him out in as strange
a way as that of the man who talked in his sleep or
the chicken thief to whom the feather clung. It was
one more proof added to the forty in Aunt Letty's
book. Richard's positiveness made a deeper impression
on her than she liked to acknowledge. She
shut her eyes a moment, squinting them up so tight
that her eyelids wrinkled, and hoped as hard as she
could hope that everything would turn out all right.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter with you, child?"
exclaimed Tippy, looking up from her letter in time
to catch Georgina with her face thus screwed into
wrinkles.</p>

<p>Georgina opened her eyes with a start.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the embarrassed answer. "I was
just thinking."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE KEEPING OF THE DUNES</div>


<div class='cap'>SCARCELY had Georgina convinced herself by
the calendar that it had been only one short week
since Barby went away instead of the endlessly long
time it seemed, than a letter was brought in to her.</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Little Rainbow-maker</span>," it began.</p>

<p>"You are surely a prism your own self, for you
have made a blessed bright spot in the world for me,
ever since you came into it. I read your letter to
papa, telling all about your birthday and the prism
Uncle Darcy gave you. It cheered him up wonderfully.
I was so proud of you when he said it was a
fine letter, and that he'd have to engage you as a
special correspondent on his paper some day.</p>

<p>"At first the doctors thought his sight was entirely
destroyed, by the flying glass of the broken windshield,
but now they are beginning to hope that one
eye at least may be saved, and possibly the other.
Papa is very doubtful about it himself, and gets very
despondent at times. He had just been having an
especially blue morning when your letter was brought
in, and he said, when I read it:</p>

<p>"'That <i>is</i> a good line to live by, daughter,' and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
had me get out his volume of Milton and read the
whole sonnet that the line is taken from. The fact
that Milton was blind when he wrote it made it specially
interesting to him.</p>

<p>"He and mamma both need me sorely now for
a little while, Baby dear, and if you can keep busy and
happy without me I'll stay away a couple of weeks
longer and help take him home to Kentucky, but I
can't be contented to stay unless you send me a postal
every day. If nothing more is on it than your name,
written by your own little fingers, it will put a rainbow
around my troubles and help me to be contented
away from you."</p>

<p>Georgina spent the rest of the morning answering
it. She had a feeling that she must make up for her
father's neglect as a correspondent, by writing often
herself. Maybe the family at Grandfather Shirley's
wouldn't notice that there was never any letter
with a Chinese stamp on it, addressed in a man's big
hand in Barby's pile of mail, if there were others for
her to smile over.</p>

<p>It had been four months since the last one came.
Georgina had kept careful count, although she had
not betrayed her interest except in the wistful way
she watched Barby when the postman came. It made
her throat ache to see that little shadow of disappointment
creep into Barby's lovely gray eyes and
then see her turn away with her lips pressed together
tight for a moment before she began to hum or speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
brightly about something else. No Chinese letter
had come in her absence to be forwarded.</p>

<p>Georgina wished her father could know how very
much Barby cared about hearing from him. Maybe
if his attention were called to it he would write
oftener. If the editor of a big newspaper like Grandfather
Shirley, thought her letters were good enough
to print, maybe her father might pay attention to
one of them. A resolve to write to him some day
began to shape itself in her mind.</p>

<p>She would have been surprised could she have
known that already one of her epistles was on its
way to him. Barby had sent him the "rainbow letter."
For Barby had not drawn off silent and hurt
when his letters ceased to come, as many a woman
would have done.</p>

<p>"Away off there in the interior he has missed the
mails," she told herself. "Or the messenger he
trusted may have failed to post his letters, or he may
be ill. I'll not judge him until I know."</p>

<p>After Georgina's letter came she resolutely put her
forebodings and misgivings aside many a time,
prompted by it to steer onward so steadily that hope
must do as Uncle Darcy said, "make rainbows even
of her tears."</p>

<p>Georgina wrote on until dinner time, telling all
about the way she had spent her birthday dollar.
After dinner when the sunshine had dried all traces
of the previous night's rain, she persuaded Tippy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that she was entirely over the effects of the gas, and
perfectly able to go down street and select the picture
postals with which to conduct her daily correspondence.</p>

<p>Richard joined her as she passed the bungalow.
They made a thrilling afternoon for themselves by
whispering to each other whenever any strange-looking
person passed them, "S'pose <i>that</i> was the owner
of the pouch and he was looking for us." The dread
of their sin finding them out walked like a silent-footed
ghost beside them all the way, making the two
pairs of brown eyes steal furtive glances at each
other now and then, and delicious little shivers of
apprehension creep up and down their backs.</p>

<p>Whether it was the passing of the unseasonable
weather into hot July sunshine again or whether the
wild-cat liniment was responsible, no one undertook
to say, but Mrs. Triplett's rheumatism left her suddenly,
and at a time when she was specially glad to be
rid of it. The Sewing Circle, to which she belonged,
was preparing for a bazaar at the Church of the
Pilgrims, and her part in it would keep her away
from home most of the time for three days.</p>

<p>That is why Georgina had unlimited freedom for
a while. She was left in Belle's charge, and Belle,
still brooding over her troubles, listlessly assented to
anything proposed to her. Belle had been allowed to
go and come as she pleased when she was ten, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
she saw no reason why Georgina was not equally
capable of taking care of herself.</p>

<p>Hardly was Mrs. Triplett out of sight that first
morning when Georgina slipped out of the back gate
with a long brass-handled fire-shovel, to meet Richard
out on the dunes. He brought a hoe, and in his
hand was the little compass imbedded in the nut.</p>

<p>When all was ready, according to Georgina's instructions,
he turned around three times, then facing
the east tossed the compass over his shoulder, saying
solemnly, "Brother, go find your brother." She
stood ready to mark the spot when it should fall, but
Captain Kidd was ahead of her and had the nut in
his teeth before she could reach the place where it
had touched the ground. So Richard took the nut
away and held the agitated little terrier by the collar
while Georgina went through the same ceremony.</p>

<p>This time Richard reached the nut before the dog,
and drew a circle around the spot where it had lain.
Then he began digging into the sand with the hoe so
industriously that Captain Kidd was moved to frantic
barking.</p>

<p>"Here, get to work yourself and keep quiet," ordered
Richard. "Rats! You'll have Cousin James
coming out to see what we're doing, first thing you
know. He thinks something is the matter now, every
time you bark. Rats! I say."</p>

<p>The magic word had its effect. After an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of quivering eagerness the dog pounced into the hole
which Richard had started, and sent the sand flying
furiously around him with his active little paws.
Georgina dragged the accumulating piles aside with
the fire-shovel on one side, and Richard plied the hoe
on the other. When the hole grew too deep for Captain
Kidd to dig in longer, Richard stepped in and
went deeper. But it was unsatisfactory work. The
shifting sand, dry as powder at this depth, was constantly
caving in and filling up the space.</p>

<p>They tried making new holes, to the north of the
old one, then to the south, then on the remaining
sides. They were still at it when the whistle at the
cold-storage plant blew for noon. Georgina rubbed
a sleeve across her red, perspiring face, and shook
the ends of her curls up and down to cool her hot
neck.</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can dig any more to-day," she
said wearily. "The sun is blistering. I feel all
scorched."</p>

<p>"I've had enough," confessed Richard. "But
we've got to find that pouch."</p>

<p>After a moment's rest, leaning on the hoe-handle,
he had an inspiration. "Let's get Manuel and Joseph
and Rosa to help us. They'd dig all day for a
nickel."</p>

<p>"I haven't one nickel left," said Georgina. Then
she thought a moment. "But I could bring some
jelly-roll. Those Fayals would dig for eats as quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
as they would for money. I'll tell Belle we're going
to have a sort of a picnic over here and she'll let me
bring all that's left in the cake box."</p>

<p>Richard investigated his pockets. A solitary nickel
was all he could turn out. "Two cents for each of
the boys and one for Rosa," he said, but Georgina
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Rosa would make trouble if you divided that
way. She'd howl till somebody came to see what
was the matter. But we could do this way. The
one who gets the least money gets the most jelly-roll.
We'll wait till the digging is over and then let
them divide it to suit themselves."</p>

<p>By five o'clock that afternoon, the compass had
been sent to "hunt brother" in a hundred different
places, and the hollow circled by the bayberry bushes
and beach plums where the pouch had been hidden
filled with deep holes. Captain Kidd had responded
to the repeated call of "Rats" until the magic word
had lost all charm for him. Even a dog comes to
understand in time when a fellow creature has "an
axe to grind." Finally, he went off and lay down,
merely wagging his tail in a bored way when any
further effort was made to arouse his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Fayal children, working valiantly in the
trenches, laid down arms at last and strolled home,
their faces streaked with jelly-roll, and Georgina
went wearily up the beach, dragging her fire-shovel
after her. She felt that she had had enough of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
dunes to last her the rest of her natural lifetime. She
seemed to see piles of sand even when she looked at
the water or when her eyes were shut.</p>

<p>"But we won't give up," she said staunchly as she
parted from Richard. "We're obliged to find that
pouch, so we've <i>got</i> to keep hope at the prow."</p>

<p>"Pity all this good digging has to be wasted," said
Richard, looking around at the various holes. "If
it had all been in one place, straight down, it would
have been deep enough to strike a pirate's chest by
this time. I hope they'll fill up before anybody comes
this way to notice them."</p>

<p>"Somehow, I'm not so anxious as I was to go off
'a-piratin' so bold,'" said Georgina with a tired sigh.
"I've had enough digging to last me forever and always,
amen."</p>

<p>The Fayal children, surfeited with one afternoon
of such effort, and not altogether satisfied as to the
division of wages which had led to war in their
midst, did not come back to the Place of the Pouch
next morning, but Richard and Georgina appeared
promptly, albeit with sore muscles and ebbing enthusiasm.
Only stern necessity and fear of consequences
kept them at their task.</p>

<p>Cousin James had reported that there was a fishing
vessel in that morning with two enormous horse
mackerel in the catch, which were to be cut up and
salted at Railroad wharf. It was deliciously cool
down on the wharf, with the breeze blowing off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
water through the great packing shed, and the white
sails scudding past the open doors like fans. With
Mrs. Triplett busy with the affairs of the Bazaar,
it would have been a wonderful opportunity for
Georgina to have gone loitering along the pier,
watching the summer people start off in motor boats
or spread themselves lazily under flapping sails for
a trip around the harbor.</p>

<p>But something of the grim spirit of their ancestors,
typified by the monument looking down on them
from the hill, nerved both Richard and Georgina one
more time to answer to the stern call of Duty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FOUND OUT</div>


<div class='cap'>"I &nbsp; DREAMED about that old pouch last night,"
said Richard in one of the intervals of rest
which they allowed themselves.</div>

<p>"I dreamed that it belonged to a Chinese man
with crooked, yellow finger-nails a foot long. He
came and stood over my bed and said that because
there was important news in that letter and we buried
it, and kept it from going to where it ought to go, <i>we</i>
had to be buried alive. And he picked me up like I
was that nut and tossed me over his shoulder, and
said, 'Brother, go find your brother.' And I began
sinking down in the sand deeper and deeper until I
began to smother."</p>

<p>Georgina made no answer. The dream did not
impress her as being at all terrifying. She had swung
her prism around her neck that morning when she
dressed, and now while she rested she amused herself
by flashing the bars of color across Captain Kidd.
Richard resented her lack of interest.</p>

<p>"Well, it may not sound very bad out here in the
daylight, but you ought to have <i>had</i> it. I yelled until
Daddy shook me and told me I'd wake up the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
end of town with such a nightmare. If you'd have
seen that old Chinaman's face like a dragon's, you'd
understand why I feel that we've just got to find that
pouch. It's going to get us into some kind of trouble,
certain sure, if we don't."</p>

<p>Georgina rose to begin digging again. "It's lucky
nobody ever comes this way to see all these holes,"
she began, but stopped with her shovel half lifted. A
familiar voice from the circle of bushes at the top of
the dune called down cheerily:</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy, mates. What port are you bound for
now? Digging through to China?"</p>

<p>"It's Uncle Darcy!" they exclaimed in the same
breath. He came plunging down the side of the dune
before they could recover from their confusion.
There was a pail of blueberries in each hand. He
had been down the state road picking them, and was
now on his way to the Gray Inn to sell them to the
housekeeper. Leaving the pails in a level spot under
the shade of a scrubby bush, he came on to where
the children were standing, and eased himself stiffly
down to a seat on the sand. It amused him to see
their evident embarrassment, and his eyes twinkled
as he inquired:</p>

<p>"What mischief are you up to now, digging all
those gopher holes?"</p>

<p>Neither answered for a moment, then Georgina
gulped and found her voice. "It's&mdash;it's a secret,"
she managed to say.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," he answered, growing instantly grave at the
sound of that word. "Then I mustn't ask any questions.
We must always keep our secrets. Sometimes
it's a pity though, when one has to promise to
do so. I hope yours isn't the burden to you that mine
is to me."</p>

<p>This was the first time he had spoken to them of
the promise they had made to him and Belle. With
a look all around as if to make certain the coast was
clear, he said:</p>

<p>"There's something I've been wanting to say to
you children ever since that day you had the rifle,
and now's as good a chance as any. I want you to
know that I never would have promised what I did
if it could have made any possible difference to
Mother. But lately she seems all confused about
Danny's trouble. She seems to have forgotten there
was any trouble except that he went away from home.
For months she's been looking for him to walk in
most any day.</p>

<p>"Ever since I gave my word to Belle, I've been
studying over the right and wrong of it. I felt I
wasn't acting fair to Danny. But now it's clear in
my mind that it <i>was</i> the right thing to do. I argue
it this way. Danny cared so much about saving Emmett
from disgrace and Belle from the pain of finding
it out, that he was willing to give up his home
and good name and everything. Now it wouldn't be
fair to him to make that sacrifice in vain by telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
while it can still be such a death-blow to Emmett's
father and hurt Belle much as ever. She's gone on
all these years fairly worshiping Emmett's memory
for being such a hero."</p>

<p>Uncle Darcy stopped suddenly and seemed to be
drawn far away from them as if he had gone inside
of himself with his own thoughts and forgotten their
presence. Georgina sat and fanned herself with her
shade hat. Richard fumbled with the little compass,
rolling it from one hand to the other, without giving
any thought to what he was doing. Presently it
rolled away from him and Captain Kidd darted after
it, striking it with his forepaws as he landed on it,
and thus rolling it still farther till it stopped at the
old man's feet.</p>

<p>Recalled to his surroundings in this way, Uncle
Darcy glanced at the object indifferently, but something
strangely familiar in its appearance made him
lean closer and give it another look. He picked it
up, examining it eagerly. Then he stood up and
gazed all around as if it had dropped from the sky
and he expected to see the hand that had dropped it.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this?" he demanded huskily,
in such a queer, breathless way that Richard thought
his day of reckoning had come. His sin had found
him out. He looked at Georgina helplessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, tell!" she exclaimed, answering his look.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;just <i>played</i> it was mine," he began.
"'Cause the initials on it are the same as mine when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
we play pirate and I'm Dare-devil Dick. I was only
going to keep it till we dug up the pouch again. We
were keeping it to help find the pouch like Tom Sawyer
did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It seemed to Richard that Uncle Darcy's hand,
clutching his shoulder, was even more threatening
than the Chinaman's of his nightmare, and his voice
more imperative.</p>

<p>"Tell me! Where did you get it? <i>That's my
compass!</i> <i>I</i> scratched those letters on that nut.
'D. D.' stands for Dan'l Darcy. I brought it home
from my last voyage. 'Twas a good-luck nut they
told me in the last port I sailed from. It was one
of the first things Danny ever played with. There's
the marks of his first little tooth under those letters.
I gave it to him when he got old enough to claim it,
for the letters were his, too. He always carried it
in his pocket and <i>he had it with him when he went
away</i>. For the love of heaven, child, tell me where
you found it?"</p>

<p>The hand which clutched Richard's shoulder was
shaking as violently as it had the day the old rifle
gave up its secret, and Richard, feeling the same unnamable
terror he had felt in his nightmare, could
only stammer, "I&mdash;I don't know. Captain Kidd
found it."</p>

<p>Then all three of them started violently, for a
hearty voice just behind them called out unexpectedly:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hullo, what's all the excitement about?"</p>

<p>It was Captain James Milford, who had strolled
down from the bungalow, his hat stuck jauntily on
the back of his head, and his hands in his pockets.
A few moments before he had been scanning the
harbor through a long spy-glass, and happening to
turn it towards the dunes had seen the two children
digging diligently with shovel and hoe.</p>

<p>"Looks as if they'd started to honey-comb the
whole Cape with holes," he thought. "Curious how
many things kids of that age can think of. It might
be well to step down and see what they're about."</p>

<p>He put up the spy-glass and started down, approaching
them on one side as the Towncrier reached
them on the other.</p>

<p>"Now for a yarn that'll make their eyes stand
out," he thought with a smile as he saw the old man
sit down on the sand.</p>

<p>"Wonder if it would sound as thrilling now as it
did when I was Dick's age. I believe I'll just slip
up and listen to one for old times' sake."</p>

<p>Uncle Darcy let go of Richard's shoulder and
turned to the newcomer appealingly.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," he said with a choke in his voice. "Look
at this! The first trace of my boy since he left me,
and they can't tell me where they got it."</p>

<p>He held out the compass and Mr. Milford took it
from his trembling fingers.</p>

<p>"Why, <i>I</i> remember this old trinket, Uncle Dan'l!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
exclaimed Mr. Milford. "You let me carry it in
my pocket one day when I was no bigger than Dicky,
here, when you took me fishing with you. I thought
it was responsible for my luck, for I made my first
big catch that day. Got a mackerel that I bragged
about all season."</p>

<p>Uncle Darcy seized the man's arm with the same
desperate grip which had held the boy's.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to understand!" he exclaimed.
"I'm trying to tell you that <i>Danny</i> is mixed up with
this in some way. Either he's been near here or
somebody else has who's seen him. He had this with
him when he went away, I tell you. These children
say they took it out of a pouch that the dog found.
Help me, Jimmy. I can't seem to think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sat weakly down on the sand again, his head in
his hands, and Mr. Milford, deeply interested,
turned to the children. His questions called out a
confusing and involved account, told piecemeal by
Georgina and Richard in turn.</p>

<p>"Hold on, now, let's get the straight of this," he
interrupted, growing more bewildered as the story
proceeded. "What was in the pouch besides the
gold pieces, the other money and this compass?"</p>

<p>"A letter with a foreign stamp on it," answered
Richard. "I noticed specially, because I have a
stamp almost like it in my album."</p>

<p>On being closely cross-questioned he could not
say positively to what country the stamp belonged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
He thought it was Siam or China. Georgina recalled
several names of towns partially scratched
out on the back of the envelope, and the word Texas.
She was sure of that and of "Mass." and of "Mrs.
Henry&mdash;&mdash;" something or other.</p>

<p>"But the inside of the letter," persisted Mr. Milford.
"Didn't you try to read that?"</p>

<p>"Course not," said Georgina, her head indignantly
high. "We only looked at each end of it to see if the
person's name was on it, but it began, 'Dear friend,'
and ended, 'Your grateful friend Dave.'"</p>

<p>"So the letter was addressed '<i>Mrs.</i>,'" began Mr.
Milford, musingly, "but was in a tobacco pouch.
The first fact argues that a woman lost it, the last
that it was a man."</p>

<p>"But it didn't smell of tobacco," volunteered
Georgina. "It was nice and clean only where Captain
Kidd chewed the string."</p>

<p>"I suppose it didn't have any smell at all," said
Mr. Milford, not as if he expected anyone to remember,
but that he happened to think of it. A
slowly dawning recollection began to brighten in
Georgina's eyes.</p>

<p>"But it did have a smell," she exclaimed. "I remember
it perfectly well now. Don't you know,
Richard, when you were untying it at the top of the
steps I said 'Phew! that makes me think of the liniment
I bought from the wild-cat woman last night,'
I had to hold the bottle in my lap all the time we
were at the moving picture show so I had a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to get pretty well acquainted with that smell. And
afterwards when we were wrapping the tin foil
around the pouch, getting ready to bury it we both
turned up our noses at the way it smelled. It seemed
stronger when the sun shone on it."</p>

<p>"The wild-cat woman," repeated Mr. Milford,
turning on Georgina. "Where was she? What did
you have to do with her? Was the dog with you?"</p>

<p>Little by little they began to recall the evening,
how they had started to the show with the Fayal
family and turned aside to hear the patent medicine
man sing, how Richard and Georgina had dared each
other to touch the wild-cat's tail through the bars,
and how Georgina in climbing down from the wheel
had stumbled over Captain Kidd whom they thought
safely shut up at home.</p>

<p>"I believe we've found a clue," said Mr. Milford
at last. "If anybody in town had lost it there'd have
been a notice put up in the post-office or the owner
would have been around for you to cry it, Uncle
Dan'l. But if it's the wild-cat woman's she probably
did not discover her loss till she was well out of town,
and maybe not until she reached her next stopping-place."</p>

<p>"There's been nothing of the sort posted on the
bulletin board at the post-office," said the old man.
"I always glance in at it every morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Milford looked at him thoughtfully as if considering
something. Then he said slowly:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle Dan'l, just how much would it mean to
you to find the owner of that pouch?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jimmy," was the tremulous answer, "if it
led to any trace of my boy it would be the one great
hope of my life realized."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure that you <i>want</i> to bring him
back? That it would be best for all concerned?"
he continued meaningly.</p>

<p>There was a silence, then the old man answered
with dignity:</p>

<p>"I know what you're thinking of, and considering
all that's gone before, I'm not blaming you, but I can
tell you this, Jimmy Milford. If the town could
know all that I know it'd be glad and proud to have
my boy brought back to it."</p>

<p>He smote the fist of one hand into the palm of the
other and looked about like something trapped, seeking
escape.</p>

<p>"It isn't fair!" he exclaimed. "It isn't fair! Him
worthy to hold up his head with the best of them, and
me bound not to tell. But I've given my promise,"
he added, shaking his head slowly from side to side.
"I s'pose it'll all work out for the best, somehow, in
the Lord's own good time, but I can't seem to see
the justice in it now."</p>

<p>He sat staring dejectedly ahead of him with dim,
appealing eyes.</p>

<p>The younger man took a step forward and laid
an arm across the bent shoulders.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Uncle Dan'l," he said heartily. "If
there's anything under the sun I can do to help you
I'm going to do it, beginning right now. Come on
up to the house and I'll begin this Sherlock Holmes
business by telephoning down the Cape to every town
on it till we locate this wild-cat liniment wagon, and
then we'll get after it as fast as the best automobile
in Provincetown can take us."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TRACING THE LINIMENT WAGON</div>


<div class='cap'>TO Wellfleet, to Orleans, to Chatham went the
telephone call, to Harwichport and then back
again to the little towns on the bay side of the Cape,
for the wild-cat and its keepers did not follow a
straight course in their meanderings. It was some
time before Mr. Milford succeeded in locating them.
At last he hung up the receiver announcing:</div>

<p>"They showed in Orleans last night all right, but
it wasn't the road to Chatham they took out of there
this morning. It was to Brewster. We can easily
overtake them somewhere along in that direction and
get back home before dark."</p>

<p>There was one ecstatic moment for Georgina when
it was made clear to her that she was included in
that "we"; that she was actually to have a share in
an automobile chase like the ones that had thrilled
her in the movies. But that moment was soon over.</p>

<p>"I hardly know what to do about leaving Mother,"
began Uncle Darcy in a troubled voice. "She's feeling
uncommon poorly to-day&mdash;she's in bed and can't
seem to remember anything longer than you're telling
it. Mrs. Saggs came in to sit with her while I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
was out blueberrying, but she said she couldn't stay
past ten o'clock. She has company coming."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you get some of the other neighbors to
come in for the few hours you'd be away?" asked
Mr. Milford. "It's important you should follow up
this clue yourself."</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Saggs is the only one who keeps
Mother from fretting when I'm away from her.
Her side window looks right into our front yard, and
ordinarily it would be enough just for her to call
across to her now and then, but it wouldn't do to-day,
Mother not being as well as common. She'd forget
where I was gone and I couldn't bear to have her
lying there frightened and worried and not remembering
why I had left her alone. She's like a child
at times. <i>You</i> know how it is," he said, turning to
Georgina. "Not flighty, but just needing to be
soothed and talked to."</p>

<p>Georgina nodded. She knew, for on several occasions
she had sat beside Aunt Elspeth when she
was in such a mood, and had quieted and pleased
her with little songs and simple rhymes. She knew
she could do it again to-day as effectually as Mrs.
Saggs, if it wasn't for giving up that exciting motor
chase after the wild-cat woman. It seemed to her
a greater sacrifice than flesh and blood should be
called upon to make. She sat on the porch step,
twirling her prism carelessly on its pink ribbon while
she waited for the machine to be brought around.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Then she climbed into the back seat with Uncle Darcy
and the two pails of blueberries, while Richard settled
himself and Captain Kidd in front with his
Cousin James.</p>

<p>They whirled up to the Gray Inn to leave the blueberries,
and then around down Bradford Street to
Fishburn Court to attempt to explain to Aunt Elspeth.
On the way they passed the Pilgrim monument.
Georgina tried not to look at it, but she
couldn't help glancing up at it from the corner of
her eye.</p>

<p>"You must," it seemed to say to her.</p>

<p>"I won't," she as silently answered back.</p>

<p>"It's your duty," it reminded her, "and the idea of
a descendant of one of the Pilgrim Fathers and one
of the Minute-men shirking her duty. A pretty member
of the Rainbow Club <i>you</i> are," it scoffed.</p>

<p>They whirled by the grim monster of a monument
quickly, but Georgina felt impelled to turn and look
back at it, her gaze following it up higher and higher,
above the gargoyles, to the tipmost stones which
seemed to touch the sky.</p>

<p>"I hate that word Duty," she said savagely to
herself. "It's as big and ugly and as always-in-front-of-you
as that old monument. They're exactly alike.
You can't help seeing them no matter which way you
look or how hard you try not to."</p>

<p>At the gate she tried to put the obnoxious word
out of her mind by leaning luxuriously back in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
car and looking up at the chimney tops while Uncle
Darcy stepped out and went into the house. He came
out again almost immediately, crossed the little front
yard and put his head in at Mrs. Saggs' side window.
After a short conversation with her he came
out to the gate and stood irresolutely fingering the
latch.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," he repeated, his voice
even more troubled than before. "Mother's asleep
now. Mrs. Saggs says she'll go over at twelve and
take her her tea, but&mdash;I can't help feeling I ought
not to leave her alone for so long. Couldn't you
manage without me?"</p>

<p>And then, Georgina inwardly protesting, "I don't
want to and I won't," found herself stepping out of
the car, and heard her own voice saying sweetly:</p>

<p>"I'll stay with Aunt Elspeth, Uncle Darcy. I can
keep her from fretting."</p>

<p>A smile of relief broke over the old man's face
and he said heartily:</p>

<p>"Why, of course you can, honey. It never occurred
to me to ask a little lass like you to stop and
care for her, but you can do it better than anybody
else, because Mother's so fond of you."</p>

<p>Neither had it occurred to him or to either of the
others that it was a sacrifice for her to give up this
ride. There was not a word from anyone about its
being a noble thing for her to do. Mr. Milford, in
a hurry to be off, merely nodded his satisfaction at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
having the matter arranged so quickly. Uncle Darcy
stepped back to the window for a parting word with
Mrs. Saggs.</p>

<p>"She'll keep an ear out for you, Georgina," he
said as he went back to the car. "Just call her if you
want her for any reason. There's plenty cooked in
the cupboard for your dinner, and Mrs. Saggs will
tend to Mother's tea when the time comes. When
she wakes up and asks for me best not tell her I'm
out of town. Just say I'll be back bye and bye, and
humor her along that way."</p>

<p>And then they were off with a whirr and a clang
that sent the chickens in the road scattering in every
direction. Georgina was left standing by the gate
thinking, "What made me do it? What <i>made</i> me
do it? I don't want to stay one bit."</p>

<p>The odor of gasoline cleared away and the usual
Sabbath-like stillness settled down over all the court.
She walked slowly across the shady little grass plot
to the front door, hesitated there a moment, then
went into the cottage and took off her hat.</p>

<p>A glance into the dim bedroom beyond showed her
Aunt Elspeth's white head lying motionless on her
pillow. The sight of the quiet sleeper made her
feel appallingly lonesome. It was like being all by
herself in the house to be there with one who made
no sound or movement. She would have to find
something to do. It was only eleven o'clock. She
tiptoed out into the kitchen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The almanac had been left lying on the table. She
looked slowly through it, and was rewarded by finding
something of interest. On the last page was a
column of riddles, and one of them was so good she
started to memorize it so that she could propound it
to Richard. She was sure he never could guess it.
Finding it harder to remember than it seemed at first
glance, she decided to copy it. She did not know
where to look for a sheet of paper, but remembered
several paper bags on the pantry shelves, so she
went in search of one. Finding one with only a cupful
of sugar left in it, she tore off the top and wrote
the riddle on that with a stub of a pencil which she
found on the table.</p>

<p>While searching for the bag she took an inventory
of the supplies in the pantry from which she was to
choose her dinner. When she had finished copying
the riddle she went back to them. There were baked
beans and blueberry pie, cold biscuit and a dish of
honey.</p>

<p>"I'll get my dinner now," she decided, "then I'll
be ready to sit with Aunt Elspeth when her tea
comes."</p>

<p>As Georgina went back and forth from table to
shelf it was in unconscious imitation of Mrs. Triplett's
brisk manner. Pattering after that capable
housekeeper on her busy rounds as persistently as
Georgina had done all her life, had taught her to
move in the same way. Presently she discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
there was a fire laid in the little wood stove ready to
light. The stove was so small in comparison to the
big kitchen range at home, that it appealed to Georgina
as a toy stove might have done. She stood looking
at it thinking what fun it would be to cook something
on it all by herself with no Tippy standing by
to say do this or don't do the other.</p>

<p>"I think I ought to be allowed to have some fun
to make up for my disappointment," she said to herself
as the temptation grew stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>"I could cook me an egg. Tippy lets me beat them
but she never lets me break them and I've always
wanted to break one and let it go plunk into the
pan."</p>

<p>She did not resist the temptation long. There was
the sputter of a match, the puff of a flame, and the
little stove was roaring away so effectively that one
of old Jeremy's sayings rose to her lips. Jeremy had
a proverb for everything.</p>

<p>"Little pot, soon hot," she said out loud, gleefully,
and reached into the cupboard for the crock of bran
in which the eggs were kept. Then Georgina's skill
as an actor showed itself again, although she was not
conscious of imitating anyone. In Tippy's best manner
she wiped out the frying-pan, settled it in a hot
place on the stove, dropped in a bit of butter.</p>

<p>With the assured air of one who has had long
practice, she picked up an egg and gave it a sharp
crack on the edge of the pan, expecting it to part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
evenly into halves and its contents to glide properly
into the butter. It looked so alluringly simple and
easy that she had always resented Tippy's saying
she would make a mess of it if she tried to do it. But
mess was the only name which could be given to what
poured out on the top of the stove as her fingers
went crashing through the shell and into the slimy
feeling contents. The broken yolk dripped from her
hands, and in the one instant she stood holding them
out from her in disgust, all the rest of the egg which
had gone sliding over the stove, cooked, scorched and
turned to a cinder.</p>

<p>The smell and smoke of the burning egg rose to
the ceiling and filled the room. Georgina sprang to
close the door so that the odor would not rouse Aunt
Elspeth, and then with carving knife and stove-lid
lifter, she scraped the charred remains into the fire.</p>

<p>"And it looked <i>so</i> easy," she mourned. "Maybe I
didn't whack it quickly enough. I'm going to try
again." She felt into the bran for another egg. This
time she struck the shell so hard that its contents
splashed out sideways with an unexpected squirt and
slid to the floor. She was ready to cry as she wiped
up the slippery stuff, but there came to her mind some
verses which Tippy had taught her long ago. And
so determined had Tippy been for her to learn them,
that she offered the inducement of a string of blue
beads. The name of the poem was "Perseverance,"
and it began:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Here's a lesson all should heed&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Try, try again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If at first you don't succeed,</span></i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;"><i>Try, try again.</i>"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and it ended,</div>

<div class='poem'>
    "<i>That which other folks can do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why with patience may not you?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Try, try again.</span></i>"
</div>

<p>Tippy sowed that seed the same winter that she
taught Georgina "The Landing of the Pilgrims"; but
surely, no matter how long a time since then, Tippy
should be held accountable for the after effects of
that planting. If Georgina persevered it was no
more than could be expected considering her rigorous
up-bringing.</p>

<p>Georgina pushed the frying-pan to the back of the
stove where it was cooler, and with her red lips
pursed into a tight line, chose another egg, smote it
sharply on the edge of the pan, thereby cracking it
and breaking the shell into halves. Her thumbs
punched through into the yolk of this one also, but
by letting part of the shell drop with it, she managed
to land it all in the pan. That was better. She fished
out the fragment of shell and took another egg.</p>

<p>This time the feat was accomplished as deftly as
an expert chef could have done it, and a pleased smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
took the place of the grim determination on Georgina's
face. Elated by her success she broke another
egg, then another and another. It was as easy as
breathing or winking. She broke another for the
pure joy of putting her dexterity to the test once
more. Then she stopped, appalled by the pile of
empty shells confronting her accusingly. She counted
them. She had broken eight&mdash;three-fourths of a setting.
What would Uncle Darcy say to such a wicked
waste? She could burn the shells, but what an awful
lot of insides to dispose of. All mixed up as they
were, they couldn't be saved for cake. There was
nothing to do but to scramble them.</p>

<p>Scramble them she did, and the pan seemed to
grow fuller and fuller as she tossed the fluffy mass
about with a fork. It was fun doing that. She made
the most of this short space of time, and it was over
all too soon. She knew that Aunt Elspeth had grown
tired of eggs early in the summer. There was no
use saving any for her. Georgina herself was not
especially fond of them, but she would have to eat
all she could to keep them from being wasted.</p>

<p>Some time after she rose from the table and looked
at the dish with a feeling of disgust that there could
still be such a quantity left, after she had eaten so
much that it was impossible to enjoy even a taste
of the blueberry pie or the honey. Carrying the dish
out through the back door she emptied it into the
cats' pan, fervently wishing that John and Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Darcy and old Yellownose could dispose of it all
without being made ill.</p>

<p>Long ago she had learned to do her sums in the
sand. Now she stooped down and with the handle
of her spoon scratched some figures in the path. "If
twelve eggs cost thirty cents, how much will eight
eggs cost?" That was the sum she set for herself.
Only that morning she had heard Tippy inquire
the price of eggs from the butter-woman, and say
they were unusually high and hard to get because
they were so many summer people in town this season.
She didn't know where they were going to get
enough for all the cakes necessary for the Bazaar.</p>

<p>It took Georgina some time to solve the problem.
Then going back to the kitchen she gathered up all
the shells and dropped them into the fire. Her sacrifice
was costing her far more than she had anticipated.
Somehow, somewhere, she must get hold of
twenty cents to pay for those eggs. Duty again.
<i>Always</i> Duty. But for that one horrid word she
would be racing down the road to Brewster in the
wake of the wild-cat woman. She wondered if they
had caught up with her yet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DANCE OF THE RAINBOW FAIRIES</div>


<div class='cap'>GEORGINA, intent on washing the frying-pan
and cleaning the last vestige of burnt egg from
the top of the stove, did not hear Mrs. Saggs come
in at the front door with Aunt Elspeth's dinner on a
tray. Nor did she hear the murmur of voices that
went on while it was being eaten. The bedroom was
in the front of the house, and the rasping noise she
was making as she scratched away with the edge of
an iron spoon, kept her from hearing anything else.
So when the door into the kitchen suddenly opened it
gave her such a start that she dropped the dishcloth
into the woodbox.</div>

<p>Mrs. Saggs sniffed suspiciously. There was something
reproachful in the mere tilt of her nose which
Georgina felt and resented.</p>

<p>"I thought I smelled something burning."</p>

<p>"I s'pect you did," Georgina answered calmly.
"But it's all over now. I was getting my dinner
early, so's I could sit with Aunt Elspeth afterward."</p>

<p>Mrs. Saggs had both hands full, as she was carrying
her tray, so she could not open the stove to look
in; but she walked over towards it and peered at it
from a closer viewpoint, continuing to sniff. But
there was nothing for her to discover, no clue to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
smell. Everything which Georgina had used was
washed and back in place now. The sharp eyes
made a survey of the kitchen, watching Georgina
narrowly as the child, having rinsed the dishcloth
after its fall, leaned out of the back door to hang
it on a bush in the sun, as Uncle Darcy always did.</p>

<p>"You've been taught to be real neat, haven't you?"
she said in an approving tone which made Georgina
like her better. Then her glance fell on a work-basket
which had been left sitting on top of the flour
barrel. In it was a piece of half-finished mending.
The sharp eyes softened.</p>

<p>"I declare!" she exclaimed. "It's downright pitiful
the way that old man tries to do for himself and
his poor old wife. It's surprising, though, how well
he gets along with the housework and taking care of
her and all."</p>

<p>She glanced again at the needle left sticking in the
clumsy unfinished seam, and recognized the garment.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you'd look at that! Even trying
to patch her poor old nightgown for her! Can you
beat that? Here, child, give it to me. My hands
are full with this tray, so just stick it under my arm.
I'll mend it this afternoon while I'm setting talking
to the company."</p>

<p>She tightened her grip on the bundle which Georgina
thrust under her arm, and looked down at it.</p>

<p>"Them pitiful old stiff fingers of his'n!" she exclaimed.
"They sure make a botch of sewing, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
they don't ever make a botch of being kind. Well,
I'm off now. Guess you'd better run in and set with
Mis' Darcy for a spell, for she's waked up real natural
and knowing now, and seems to crave company."</p>

<p>Georgina went, but paused on the way, seeing
the familiar rooms in a new light, since Mrs. Saggs'
remarks had given her new and illuminating insight.
Everywhere she looked there was something as eloquent
as that bit of unfinished mending to bear witness
that Uncle Darcy was far more than just a
weather-beaten old man with a smile and word of
cheer for everybody. Ringing the Towncrier's bell
and fishing and blueberrying and telling yarns and
helping everybody bear their trouble was the least
part of his doings. That was only what the world
saw. That was all she had seen herself until this
moment.</p>

<p>Now she was suddenly aware of his bigness of soul
which made him capable of an infinite tenderness and
capacity to serve. His devotion to Aunt Elspeth
spread an encircling care around her as a great oak
throws the arms of its shade, till her comfort was his
constant thought, her happiness his greatest desire.</p>

<p>"Them pitiful, old, stiff fingers of his'n!" How
could Mrs. Saggs speak of them so? They were
heroic, effectual fingers. Theirs was something far
greater than the Midas touch&mdash;they transmuted the
smallest service into Love's gold.</p>

<p>Georgina, with her long stretching up to books that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
were "over her head," understood this without being
able to put it into words. Nor could she put into
words the longing which seized her like a dull ache,
for <i>Barby</i> to be loved and cared for like that, to be
as constantly and supremely considered. She
couldn't understand how Aunt Elspeth, old and
wrinkled and childish, could be the object of such
wonderful devotion, and Barby, her adorable, winsome
Barby, call forth less.</p>

<p>"Not one letter in four long months," she thought
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Dan'l," called Aunt Elspeth feebly from the next
room, and Georgina went in to assure her that Uncle
Darcy was <i>not</i> out in the boat and would not be
brought home drowned. He was attending to some
important business and would be back bye and bye.
In the meantime, she was going to hang her prism
in the window where the sun could touch it and let the
rainbow fairies dance over the bed.</p>

<p>The gay flashes of color, darting like elfin wings
here and there as Georgina twisted the ribbon,
pleased Aunt Elspeth as if she were a child. She
lifted a thin, shriveled hand to catch at them and
gave a weak little laugh each time they eluded her
grasp. It was such a thin hand, almost transparent,
with thick, purplish veins standing out on it.
Georgina glanced at her own and wondered if Aunt
Elspeth's ever could have been dimpled and soft like
hers. It did not seem possible that this frail old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
woman with the snowy-white hair and sunken cheeks
could ever have been a rosy child like herself. As
if in answer to her thought, Aunt Elspeth spoke,
groping again with weak, ineffectual passes after the
rainbows.</p>

<p>"I can't catch them. They bob around so. That's
the way I used to be, always on the move. They
called me 'Bouncing Bet!'"</p>

<p>"Tell me about that time," urged Georgina. Back
among early memories Aunt Elspeth's mind walked
with firm, unfailing tread. It was only among those
of later years that she hesitated and groped her way
as if lost in fog. By the time the clock had struck
the hours twice more Georgina felt that she knew intimately
a mischievous girl whom her family called
Bouncing Bet for her wild ways, but who bore no
trace of a resemblance to the feeble old creature who
recounted her pranks.</p>

<p>And the blue-eyed romp who could sail a boat like
a boy or swim like a mackerel grew up into a slender
slip of a lass with a shy grace which made one think
of a wild-flower. At least that is what the old
daguerreotype showed Georgina when Aunt Elspeth
sent her rummaging through a trunk to find it.
It was taken in a white dress standing beside a young
sailor in his uniform. No wonder Uncle Darcy
looked proud in the picture. But Georgina never
would have known it was Uncle Darcy if she hadn't
been told. He had changed, too.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The picture <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'make'">made</ins> Georgina think of one of Barby's
songs, and presently when Aunt Elspeth was
tired of talking she sang it to her:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Hand in hand when our life was May.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hand in hand when our hair is gray.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sorrow and sun for everyone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As the years roll on.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hand in hand when the long night tide</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gently covers us side by side&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ah, lad, though we know not when,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Love will be with us forever then.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Always the same, Darby my own,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Always the same to your old wife Joan!"</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>After that there were other songs which Aunt Elspeth
asked for, "Oh, wert thou in the cauld blast,"
and "Robin Adair." Then came a long tiresome
pause when Georgina didn't know what to do next,
and Aunt Elspeth turned her head restlessly on the
pillow and seemed uneasy.</p>

<p>Georgina wished with all her heart she was out
of the stuffy little bedroom. If she had gone with
the others, she would be speeding along the smooth,
white road now, coming home from Brewster, with
the wind and sunshine of all the wide, free outdoors
around her.</p>

<p>Aunt Elspeth drew a long, tired sigh.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe you'd like me to read to you," ventured
Georgina. She hesitated over making such an offer,
because there were so few books in the house. Nothing
but the almanac looked interesting. Aunt Elspeth
assented, and pointed out a worn little volume
of devotions on top of the bureau, saying:</p>

<p>"That's what Dan'l reads me on Sundays."</p>

<p>Georgina opened it. Evidently it had been compiled
for the use of sea-faring people, for it was full
of the promises that sailor-folk best understand;
none of the shepherd psalms or talk of green pastures
and help-giving hills. It was all about mighty
waters and paths through the deep. She settled herself
comfortably in the low rocking-chair beside the
bed, tossed back her curls and was about to begin,
when one of the rainbow lights from the prism
danced across the page. She waited, smiling, until it
glimmered away. Then she read the verses on which
it had shone.</p>

<p>"<i>All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me,
yet the Lord will command His loving kindness in the
daytime, and in the night His song shall be with me.</i>"</p>

<p>The sweet little voice soothed the troubled spirit
that listened like music.</p>

<p>"<i>When thou passeth through the waters I will be
with thee, and through the rivers: they shall not overflow
thee.... Thus saith the Lord which maketh
a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters.</i>"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Elspeth reached out a groping hand for
Georgina's and took the soft little fingers in hers.
Georgina didn't want to have her hand held, especially
in such a stiff, bony clasp. It made her uncomfortable
to sit with her arm stretched up in such a
position, but she was too polite to withdraw it, so she
read on for several pages.</p>

<p>"<i>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves
thereof are still. So He bringeth them into their desired
haven.</i>"</p>

<p>Attracted by the sound of heavy breathing, she
looked up. Aunt Elspeth was asleep. Georgina
laid the book on the table, and slowly, very slowly
began to raise herself out of the chair, afraid of
arousing the sleeper who still held her hand. As she
stood up, the board in the floor under her squeaked.
She was afraid to take another step or to try to pull
her hand away. She had come to the end of her resources
for entertainment, and she was afraid Aunt
Elspeth's next awakening might be to a crying, restless
mood which she could not control. So she sat
down again.</p>

<p>It was very still in the bedroom. A fly buzzed
on the outside of the window screen, and away off
on another street the "accommodation" was going
by. She could hear the bells jingling on the horses.
As she sat thus, not even rocking, but just jiggling
the chair a trifle, the words she had read began to
come back to her after a while like a refrain: "So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
He bringeth them into their desired haven. So He
bringeth them into their desired haven." She whispered
them over and over as she often whispered
songs, hearing the music which had no tone except in
her thought.</p>

<p>And presently, as the whispered song repeated itself,
the words began to bring a wonderful sense of
peace and security. She did not realize what it was
that was speaking to her through them. It was the
faith which had lived so long in these lowly little
rooms. It was the faith which had upborne Uncle
Darcy year after year, helping him to steer onward
in the confidence that the Hand he trusted would
fulfil all its promises. She felt the subtle influence
that goes out from such lives, without knowing what
it was that touched her. She was conscious of it
only as she was conscious of the nearness of mignonette
when its fragrance stole in from the flower-bed
under the window. They were both unseen but the
mignonette's fragrance was wonderfully sweet, and
the feeling of confidence, breathing through the
words of the old psalm was wonderfully strong.
Some day she, too, would be brought, and Barby
would be brought into "their desired haven."</p>

<p>Georgina was tired. It had been a full day, beginning
with that digging in the dunes. Presently
she began to nod. Then the rocking chair ceased to
sway. When the clock struck again she did not hear
it. She was sound asleep with her hand still clasped
in Aunt Elspeth's.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ON THE TRAIL OF THE WILD-CAT WOMAN</div>


<div class='cap'>MEANWHILE, the pursuing party had made the
trip to Brewster and were on their way home.
At the various small towns where they stopped to
ask questions, they found that the patent-medicine
vendors had invariably followed one course. They
had taken supper at the hotel, but after each evening's
performance had driven into the country a
little way to camp for the night in the open. At
Orleans an acquaintance of Mr. Milford's in a feed
store had much to say about them.</div>

<p>"I don't know whether they camp out of consideration
for the wild-cat, or whether it's because they're
attached to that rovin', gypsy life. They're good
spenders, and from the way they sold their liniment
here last night, you'd think they could afford to put
up at a hotel all the time and take a room for the
cat in the bargain. You needn't tell me that beast
ever saw the banks of the Brazos. I'll bet they
caught it up in the Maine woods some'rs. But they
seem such honest, straightforward sort of folks,
somehow you have to believe 'em. They're a friendly
pair, too, specially the old lady. Seems funny to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
hear you speak of her as the wild-cat woman. That
name is sure a misfit for her."</p>

<p>Mr. Milford thought so himself, when a little later
he came across her, a mile out of Brewster. She was
sitting in the wooden rocking chair in one end of the
wagon, placidly darning a pair of socks, while she
waited for her husband to bring the horses from some
place up in the woods where he had taken them for
water. They had been staked by the roadside all
night to graze. The wild-cat was blinking drowsily
in its cage, having just been fed.</p>

<p>Some charred sticks and a little pile of ashes by
the roadside, showed where she had cooked dinner
over a camp-fire, but the embers were carefully extinguished
and the frying pan and dishes were stowed
out of sight in some mysterious compartment under
the wagon bed, as compactly as if they had been
parts of a Chinese puzzle. Long experience on the
road had taught her how to pack with ease and dexterity.</p>

<p>She looked up with interest as the automobile drew
out of the road, and stopped alongside the wagon.
She was used to purchasers following them out of
town for the liniment after a successful show like
last night's performance.</p>

<p>Despite the feedman's description of her, Mr.
Milford had expected to see some sort of an adventuress
such as one naturally associates with such a
business, and when he saw the placid old lady with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the smooth, gray hair, and met the gaze of the
motherly eyes peering over her spectacles at him, he
scarcely knew how to begin. Uncle Darcy, growing
impatient at the time consumed in politely leading
up to the object of their coming, fidgetted in his seat.
At last he could wait no longer for remarks about
weather and wild-cats. Such conversational paths led
nowhere. He interrupted abruptly.</p>

<p>"I'm the Towncrier from Provincetown, ma'am.
Did you lose anything while you were there?"</p>

<p>"Well, now," she began slowly. "I can't say
where I lost it. I didn't think it was in Provincetown
though. I made sure it was some place between Harwichport
and Orleans, and I had my man post notices
in both those places."</p>

<p>"And what was it you lost?" inquired Mr. Milford
politely. He had cautioned his old friend on
the way down at intervals of every few miles, not to
build his hopes up too much on finding that this
woman was the owner of the pouch.</p>

<p>"You may have to follow a hundred different clues
before you get hold of the right one," he warned
him. "We're taking this trip on the mere chance that
we'll find the owner, just because two children associated
the pouch in their memory with the odor of
liniment. It is more than likely they're mistaken
and that this is all a wild-goose chase."</p>

<p>But Uncle Darcy <i>had</i> built his hopes on it, had set
his heart on finding this was the right clue, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
beaming face said, "I told you so," when she answered:</p>

<p>"It was a little tobacco pouch, and I'm dreadfully
put out over losing it, because aside from the valuables
and keep-sakes in it there was a letter that's
been following me all over the country. It didn't
reach me till just before I got to Provincetown. It's
from some heathen country with such an outlandish
name I couldn't remember it while I was reading it,
scarcely, and now I'll never think of it again while
the world wags, and there's no way for me to answer
it unless I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" exclaimed Uncle Darcy.
"You <i>must</i> think of it. And I <i>must</i> know. How did
this come into your hands?"</p>

<p>He held out the little watch-fob charm, the compass
set in a nut and she seized it eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, you did find my pouch, didn't you?" she
exclaimed. "I made sure that was what you were
aiming to tell me. That's a good-luck charm. It
was given to me as much as eight years ago, by a
young fellow who was taken sick on our ranch down
in Texas. He'd been working around the docks in
Galveston, but came on inland because somebody
roped him in to believe he could make a fortune in
cattle in a few months. He was riding fences for
Henry, and he came down with a fever and Henry
and me nursed him through."</p>

<p>Always talkative, she poured out her information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
now in a stream, drawn on by the compelling eagerness
of the old man's gaze.</p>

<p>"He was a nice boy and the most grateful soul
you ever saw. But he didn't take to the cattle business,
and he soon pushed on. He was all broke up
when it came to saying good-bye. You could see
that, although he's one of your quiet kind, hiding his
real feelings like an Indian. He gave me this good-luck
charm when he left, because he didn't have anything
else to give, to show he appreciated our nursing
him and doing for him, and he said that he'd
<i>make</i> it bring us good luck or die a-trying and we'd
hear from him some of these days."</p>

<p>"And you did?"</p>

<p>The old man's face was twitching with eagerness
as he asked the question.</p>

<p>"Yes, about five years ago he sent us a nice little
check at Christmas. Said he had a good job with
a wealthy Englishman who spent his time going
around the world discovering queer plants and writing
books about them. He was in South America
then. We've heard from him several times since.
This last letter followed me around from pillar to
post, always just missing me and having to have the
address scratched out and written over till you could
hardly make head or tail of what was on it.</p>

<p>"He asked me to write to the address he gave me,
but whether it was in 'Afric's sunny fountain or India's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
coral strand,' I can't tell now. It was some
heathenish 'land in error's chain,' as the missionary
hymn says. I was so worried over losing the letter
on account of the address, for he did seem so bent
on hearing from us, and he's a nice boy. I'd hate
to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'loose'">lose</ins> track of him. So I'm mighty thankful you
found the pouch."</p>

<p>She stopped, expecting them to hand it over.
Mr. Milford made the necessary explanation.
He told of Captain Kidd finding it and bringing
it home, of the two children burying it in
play and the storm sweeping away every trace of the
markers. While he told the story several automobiles
passed them and the occupants leaned out to
look at the strange group beside the road. It was
not every day one could see an old lady seated in a
rocking chair in one end of an unattached wagon
with a wild-cat in the other. These passing tourists
would have thought it stranger still, could they have
known how fate had been tangling the life threads of
these people who were in such earnest conversation,
or how it had wound them together into a queer skein
of happenings.</p>

<p>"And the only reason this compass was saved,"
concluded Mr. Milford, "was because it had the
initials 'D. D.' scratched on it, which stands for this
little boy's name when he plays pirate&mdash;Dare-devil
Dick."</p>

<p>The motherly eyes smiled on Richard. "If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
want to know the real name those letters stand for,"
she said, "it's Dave Daniels. That's the name of the
boy who gave it to me."</p>

<p>Richard looked alarmed, and even Mr. Milford
turned with a questioning glance towards Uncle
Darcy, about to say something, when the old man
leaned past him and spoke quickly, almost defiantly,
as a child might have done.</p>

<p>"That's all right. I don't care what he told you
his name was. He had a good reason for changing
it. And I'm going to tell you this much no matter
what I promised. <i>I</i> scratched those initials on there
my own self, over forty years ago. And the boy
who gave it to you <i>is</i> named Daniel, but it's his first
name, same as mine. Dan'l Darcy. And the boy's
mine, and I've been hunting him for ten long years,
and I've faith to believe that the good Lord isn't
going to disappoint me now that I'm this near the end
of my hunt. He had a good reason for going away
from home the way he did. He'd a good reason for
changing his name as he did, but the time has come
now when it's all right for him to come back and,"
shaking his finger solemnly and impressively at the
woman, "<i>I want you to get that word back to him
without fail</i>."</p>

<p>"But this is only circumstantial evidence, Uncle
Dan'l," said Mr. Milford, soothingly. "You haven't
any real proof that this Dave is your Danny."</p>

<p>"Proof, proof," was the excited answer. "I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
you, man, I've all the proof I need. All I ask for
is the address in that letter. I'll find my boy quick
enough."</p>

<p>"But I don't know," was all the woman could
answer. "The only way in the world to find it is to
dig up that pouch."</p>

<p>"But even if you can't remember the new address
tell me one of the old ones," he pleaded. "I'll
take a chance on writing there and having it forwarded."</p>

<p>But the woman could not recall the name of a single
city. South America, Australia, New Zealand,
she remembered he had been in those countries, but
that was all. Richard, upon being cross-questioned
again, "b'leeved" the stamp was from Siam or China
but couldn't be certain which.</p>

<p>"Here comes Henry!" exclaimed the woman in a
relieved tone. "Maybe he'll remember."</p>

<p>Henry, a tall, raw-boned man with iron-gray hair
under his Texas sombrero, in his shirt sleeves and
with his after-dinner pipe still in his mouth, came
leisurely out of the woods, leading the horses. They
were already harnessed, ready to be hitched to the
wagon. He backed them up to the tongue and
snapped the chains in place before he paused to give
the strangers more than a passing nod of greeting.
Then he came around to the side of the wagon nearest
the machine, and putting one foot up on a spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of his front wheel, leaned over in a listening attitude,
while the whole story was repeated for his benefit.</p>

<p>"So you're his father," he said musingly, looking
at Uncle Darcy with shrewd eyes that were used to
appraising strangers.</p>

<p>"Who ever would a thought of coming across
Dave Daniels' tracks up here on old Cape Cod?
You look like him though. I bet at his age you were
as much alike as two peas in a pod. I never did
know where he hailed from. He was a close-mouthed
chap. But I somehow got the idea he must
have been brought up near salt water. He talked so
much sailor lingo."</p>

<p>"Put on your thinking-cap, Henry," demanded his
wife. "The gentlemen wants to know where that
last letter was written from, what the postmark was,
or the address inside, or what country the stamp belonged
to. And if you don't know that, what are
some of the other places he wrote to us from?"</p>

<p>"You're barking up the wrong tree when you ask
<i>me</i> any such questions," was the only answer he could
give. "I didn't pay any attention to anything but
the reading matter."</p>

<p>Questions, surmises, suggestions, everything that
could be brought up as aids to memory were of no
avail. Henry's memory was a blank in that one important
particular. Finally, Mr. Milford took two
five-dollar gold pieces out of his pocket and a handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of small change which he dropped into the woman's
lap despite her protests.</p>

<p>"We'll square up the damage the children did as
far as possible," he said with a laugh. "But we can't
get the letter back until the wind is ready to turn the
dunes topsy-turvy again. That may be in years and
it may be never. Let me have your address and if
ever it is found it shall be sent directly back to you,
and the children can inherit the money if I'm not
here to claim it."</p>

<p>The man made a wry face at mention of his address.
"We sort of belong to what they call the
floating population now. Home with us means any
old place where Mother happens to set her rocking
chair. We've turned the ranch over to my daughter
and her husband while we see something of the
world, and as long as things go as smoothly as they
do, we're in no great shakes of a hurry to get back."</p>

<p>"But the ranch address will always find us,
Henry," she insisted. "Write it down for the gentlemen.
Ain't this been a strange happening?" she
commented, as she received Mr. Milford's card in
return with the Towncrier's name penciled on the
back. She looked searchingly at Richard.</p>

<p>"I remember you, now," she said. "There was
such a pretty little girl with you&mdash;climbed up on the
wagon to touch Tim's tail through the bars. She
had long curls and a smile that made me want to
hug her. She bought a bottle of liniment, I remember,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and I've thought of her a dozen times since
then, thought how a little face like that brightens up
all the world around it."</p>

<p>"That was Georgina Huntingdon," volunteered
Richard.</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's a pretty name. Write it down
on the other side of this piece of paper, sonny, and
yours, too. Then when I go about the country I'll
know what to call you when I think about you. This
is just like a story. If there was somebody who
knew how to write it up 'twould make a good piece
for the papers, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>They were ready to start back now, since there
was no more information to be had, but on one pretext
or another Uncle Darcy delayed. He was so
pitifully eager for more news of Danny. The smallest
crumb about the way he looked, what he did and
said was seized upon hungrily, although it was news
eight years old. And he begged to hear once more
just what it was Danny had said about the Englishman,
and the work they were doing together. He
could have sat there the rest of the day listening to
her repeat the same things over and over if he had
had his wish. Then she asked a question.</p>

<p>"Who is Belle? I mind when he was out of his
head so long with the fever he kept saying, '<i>Belle</i>
mustn't suffer. No matter what happens <i>Belle</i> must
be spared.' I remembered because that's my name,
and hearing it called out in the dead of night the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
way a man crazy with fever would call it, naturally
makes you recollect it."</p>

<p>"That was just a friend of his," answered Uncle
Darcy, "the girl who was going to marry his chum."</p>

<p>"Oh," was the answer in a tone which seemed to
convey a shade of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'disappontment'">disappointment</ins>. "I thought
maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not finish the sentence, for the engine had
begun to shake noisily, and it seemed to distract her
thoughts. And now there being really nothing more
to give them an excuse for lingering they said good-bye
to their wayside acquaintances, feeling that they
were parting from two old friends, so cordial were
the good wishes which accompanied the leave-taking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RAINBOW GAME</div>


<div class='cap'>WITH her arm stiff and cramped from being
held so long in one position, Georgina waked
suddenly and looked around her in bewilderment.
Uncle Darcy was in the room, saying something
about her riding home in the machine. He didn't
want to hurry her off, but Mr. Milford was waiting
at the gate, and it would save her a long walk
home&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<p>While he talked he was leaning over Aunt Elspeth,
patting her cheek, and she was clinging to his hand
and smiling up at him as if he had just been restored
to her after a long, long absence, instead of a separation
of only a few hours. And he looked so glad
about something, as if the nicest thing in the world
had happened, that Georgina rubbed her eyes and
stared at him, wondering what it could have been.</p>

<p>Evidently, it was the honk of the horn which had
aroused Georgina, and when it sounded again she
sprang up, still confused by the suddenness of her
awakening, with only one thing clear in her mind, the
necessity for haste. She snatched her prism from
the window and caught up her hat as she ran through
the next room, but not until she was half-way home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
did she remember that she had said nothing about
the eggs and had asked no questions about the trip
to Brewster. She had not even said good-bye.</p>

<p>Mr. Milford nodded pleasantly when she went
out to the car, saying, "Hop in, kiddie," but he did
not turn around after they started and she did not
feel well enough acquainted with him to shout out
questions behind his back. Besides, after they had
gone a couple of blocks he began explaining something
to Richard, who was sitting up in front of
him, about the workings of the car, and kept on explaining
all the rest of the way home. She couldn't
interrupt.</p>

<p>Not until she climbed out in front of her own gate
with a shy "Thank you, Mr. Milford, for bringing
me home," did she find courage and opportunity to
ask the question she longed to know.</p>

<p>"Did you find the woman? <i>Was</i> it her pouch?"</p>

<p>Mr. Milford was leaning forward in his seat to
examine something that had to do with the shifting
of the gears, and he answered while he investigated,
without looking up.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she couldn't remember where the letter
was from, so we're not much wiser than we were before,
except that we know for a certainty that Dan
was alive and well less than two months ago. At
least Uncle Dan'l believes it is Dan. The woman
calls him Dave, but Uncle Dan'l vows they're one
and the same."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Having adjusted the difficulty, Mr. Milford, with
a good-bye nod to Georgina, started on down the
street again. Georgina stood looking after the rapidly
disappearing car.</p>

<p>"Well, no wonder Uncle Darcy looked so happy,"
she thought, recalling his radiant face. "It was
knowing that Danny is alive and well that made it
shine so. I wish I'd been along. Wish I could have
heard every thing each one of them said. I could
have remembered every single word to tell Richard,
but he won't remember even half to tell me."</p>

<p>It was in the pursuit of all the information which
could be pumped out of Richard that Georgina
sought the Green Stairs soon after breakfast next
morning. Incidentally, she was on her way to a
nearby grocery and had been told to hurry. She
ran all the way down in order to gain a few extra
moments in which to loiter. As usual at this time
of morning, Richard was romping over the terraces
with Captain Kidd.</p>

<p>"Hi, Georgina," he called, as he spied her coming.
"I've got a new game. A new way to play
tag. Look."</p>

<p>Plunging down the steps he held out for her inspection
a crystal paperweight which he had picked
up from the library table. Its round surface had been
cut into many facets, as a diamond is cut to make it
flash the light, and the spots of color it threw as he
turned it in the sun were rainbow-hued.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"See," he explained. "Instead of tagging Captain
Kidd with my hand I touch him with a rainbow,
and it's lots harder to do because you can't always
make it light where you want it to go, or where you
think it is going to fall. I've only tagged him twice
so far in all the time I've been trying, because he
bobs around so fast. Come on, I'll get you before
you tag me," he added, seeing that her prism hung
from the ribbon on her neck.</p>

<p>She did not wear it every day, but she had felt an
especial need for its comforting this morning, and
had put it on as she slowly dressed. The difficulty
of restoring the eggs loomed up in front of her as a
real trouble, and she needed this to remind her to
keep on hoping that some way would soon turn up
to end it.</p>

<p>It was a fascinating game. Such tags are elusive,
uncertain things. The pursuer can never be certain
of touching the pursued. Georgina entered into it,
alert and glowing, darting this way and that to escape
being touched by the spots of vivid color. Her
prism threw it in bars, Richard's in tiny squares and
triangles.</p>

<p>"Let's make them fight!" Richard exclaimed in
the midst of it, and for a few moments the color
spots flashed across each other like flocks of darting
birds. Suddenly Georgina stopped, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot. I'm on my way to the grocery, and
I must hurry back. But I wanted to ask you two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
things. One was, tell me all about what the woman
said yesterday, and the other was, think of some way
for me to earn twenty cents. There isn't time to
hear about the first one now, but think right quick
and answer the second question."</p>

<p>She started down the street, skipping backwards
slowly, and Richard walked after her.</p>

<p>"Aw, I don't know," he answered in a vague way.
"At home when we wanted to make money we always
gave a show and charged a penny to get in, or
we kept a lemonade stand; but we don't know enough
kids here to make that pay."</p>

<p>Then he looked out over the water and made a
suggestion at random. A boy going along the beach
towards one of the summer cottages with a pail in
his hand, made him think of it.</p>

<p>"Pick blueberries and sell them."</p>

<p>"I thought of that," answered Georgina, still
progressing towards the grocery backward. "And
it would be a good time now to slip away while Tippy's
busy with the Bazaar. This is the third day.
But they've done so well they're going to keep on with
it another day, and they've thought up a lot of new
things to-morrow to draw a crowd. One of them
is a kind of talking tableau. I'm to be in it, so it
wouldn't do for me to go and get my hands all stained
with berries when I'm to be dressed up as a part of
the show for the whole town to come and take a look
at me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard had no more suggestions to offer, so with
one more flash of the prism and a cry of "last tag,"
Georgina turned and started on a run to the grocery.
Richard and the paperweight followed in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>Up at one of the front windows of the bungalow,
two interested spectators had been watching the game
below. One was Richard's father, the other was a
new guest of Mr. Milford's who had arrived only
the night before. He was the Mr. Locke who was
to take Richard and his father and Cousin James
away on his yacht next morning. He was also a
famous illustrator of juvenile books, and he sometimes
wrote the rhymes and fairy tales himself which
he illustrated. Everybody in this town of artists who
knew anything at all of the world of books and pictures
outside, knew of Milford Norris Locke. Now
as he watched the graceful passes of the two children
darting back and forth on the board-walk below, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Who's the little girl, Moreland? She's the child
of my dreams&mdash;the very one I've been hunting for
weeks. She has not only the sparkle and spirit that
I want to put into those pictures I was telling you
about, but the grace and the curls and the mischievous
eyes as well. Reckon I could get her to pose for
me?"</p>

<p>That is how it came about that Georgina found
Richard's father waiting for her at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Green Stairs when she came running back from the
grocery. When she went home a few minutes later,
she carried with her something more than the cake
of sweet chocolate that Tippy had sent her for in
such a hurry. It was the flattering knowledge that
a famous illustrator had asked to make a sketch of
her which would be published in a book if it turned
out to be a good one.</p>

<p>With a sailing party and a studio reception and
several other engagements to fill up his one day in
Provincetown, Mr. Locke could give only a part of
the morning to the sketches, and wanted to begin as
soon as possible. So a few minutes after Georgina
went dancing in with the news, he followed in Mr.
Milford's machine. He arrived so soon after, in
fact, that Tippy had to receive him just as she was
in her gingham house dress and apron.</p>

<p>After looking all over the place he took Georgina
down to the garden and posed her on a stone
bench near the sun-dial, at the end of a tall, bright
aisle of hollyhocks. There was no time to waste.</p>

<p>"We'll pretend you're sitting on the stone rim of
a great fountain in the King's garden," he said.
"You're trying to find some trace of the beautiful
Princess who has been bewitched and carried away
to a castle under the sea, that had 'a ceiling of
amber, a pavement of pearl.'"</p>

<p>Georgina looked up, delighted that he had used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a line from a poem she loved. It made her feel as
if he were an old friend.</p>

<p>"This is for a fairy tale that has just begun to
hatch itself out in my mind, so you see it isn't all
quite clear yet. There'll be lily pads in the fountain.
Maybe you can hear what they are saying, or maybe
the gold-fish will bring you a message, because you
are a little mortal who has such a kind heart that
you have been given the power to understand the
speech of everything which creeps or swims or flies."</p>

<p>Georgina leaned over and looked into the imaginary
fountain dubiously, forgetting in her interest
of the moment that her companion was the great Milford
Norris Locke. She was entering with him into
the spirit of his game of "pretend" as if he were
Richard.</p>

<p>"No, I'll tell you," she suggested. "Have it a
frog instead of a fish that brings the message. He
can jump right out of that lily pad on to the edge
of the fountain where I am sitting, and then when
you look at the picture you can see us talking together.
No one could tell what I was doing if they
saw me just looking down into the fountain, but they
could tell right away if the frog was here and I was
shaking my finger at him as if I were saying:</p>

<p>"'Now tell me the truth, Mr. Frog, or the Ogre
of the Oozy Marsh shall eat you ere the day be
done.'"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't move. Don't move!" called Mr. Locke,
excitedly. "Ah, that's perfect. That's exactly what
I want. Hold that pose for a moment or two. Why,
Georgina, you've given me exactly what I wanted and
a splendid idea besides. It will give the fairy tale an
entirely new turn. If you can only hold that position
a bit longer, then you may rest."</p>

<p>His pencil flew with magical rapidity and as he
sketched he kept on talking in order to hold the look
of intense interest which showed in her glowing
face.</p>

<p>"I dearly love stories like that," sighed Georgina
when he came to the end and told her to lean back
and rest a while.</p>

<p>"Barby&mdash;I mean my mother&mdash;and I act them all
the time, and sometimes we make them up ourselves."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'll write them when you grow up,"
suggested Mr. Locke not losing a moment, but
sketching her in the position she had taken of her
own accord.</p>

<p>"Maybe I shall," exclaimed Georgina, thrilled
by the thought. "My grandfather Shirley said I
could write for his paper some day. You know he's
an editor, down in Kentucky. I'd like to be the editor
of a magazine that children would adore the way
I do the <i>St. Nicholas</i>."</p>

<p>Tippy would have said that Georgina was "running
on." But Mr. Locke did not think so. Children
always opened their hearts to him. He held the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
magic key. Georgina found it easier to tell him her
inmost feelings than anybody else in the world but
Barby.</p>

<p>"That's a beautiful game you and Dicky were
playing this morning," he remarked presently, "tagging
each other with rainbows. I believe I'll put it
into this fairy tale, have the water-nixies do it as
they slide over the water-fall."</p>

<p>"But it isn't half as nice as the game we play in
earnest," she assured him. "In our Rainbow Club
we have a sort of game of tag. We tag a person
with a good time, or some kindness to make them
happy, and we pretend that makes a little rainbow
in the world. Do you think it does?"</p>

<p>"It makes a very real one, I am sure," was the
serious answer. "Have you many members?"</p>

<p>"Just Richard and me and the bank president, Mr.
Gates, so far, but&mdash;but you can belong&mdash;if you'd
like to."</p>

<p>She hesitated a trifle over the last part of her invitation,
having just remembered what a famous
man she was talking to. He might think she was
taking a liberty even to suggest that he might care
to belong.</p>

<p>"I'd like it very much," he assured her gravely,
"if you think I can live up to the requirements."</p>

<p>"Oh, you already have," she cried. "Think of all
the happy hours you have made for people with
your books and pictures&mdash;just swarms and bevies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and <i>flocks</i> of rainbows! We would have put you on
the list of honorary members anyhow. Those are
the members who don't know they are members,"
she explained. "They're just like the prisms themselves.
Prisms don't know they are prisms but everybody
who looks at them sees the beautiful places they
make in the world."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="386" height="600" alt="Sea of dreams illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Georgina," he said solemnly, "that is the very
loveliest thing that was ever said to me in all my
life. Make me club member number four and I'll
play the game to my very best ability. I'll try to do
some tagging really worth while."</p>

<p>He had been sketching constantly all the time he
talked, and now, impelled by curiosity, Georgina got
up from the stone bench and walked over to take
a look at his work. He had laid aside the several
outline studies he had made of her, and was now
exercising his imagination in sketching a ship.</p>

<p>"This is to be the one that brings the Princess
home, and in a minute I want you to pose for the
Princess, for she is to have curls, long, golden ones,
and she is to hold her head as you did a few moments
ago when you were talking about looking off to
sea."</p>

<p>Georgina brought her hands together in a quick
gesture as she said imploringly, "Oh, <i>do</i> put Hope at
the prow. Every time I pass the Figurehead House
and see Hope sitting up on the portico roof I wish I
could see how she looked when she was riding the
waves on the prow of a gallant vessel. That's where
she ought to be, I heard a man say. He said Hope
squatting on a portico roof may look ridiculous, but
Hope breasting the billows is superb."</p>

<p>Mr. Locke was no stranger in the town. He knew
the story of the figurehead as the townspeople knew
it, now he heard its message as Uncle Darcy knew it.
He listened as intently to Georgina as she had listened
to him. At the end he lifted his head, peering
fixedly through half-closed eyes at nothing.</p>

<p>"You have made me see the most beautiful ship,"
he said, musingly. "It is a silver shallop coming
across a sea of Dreams, its silken sails set wide, and
at the prow is an angel. 'White-handed Hope, thou
hovering angel girt with golden wings,'" he quoted.
"Yes, I'll make it with golden wings sweeping back
over the sides this way. See?"</p>

<p>His pencil flew over the paper again, showing her
in a few swift strokes an outline of the vision she
had given him.</p>

<p>And now Tippy would have said not only that
Georgina was "running on," but that she was "wound
up," for with such a sympathetic and appreciative
listener, she told him the many things she would have
taken to Barby had she been at home. Especially,
she talked about her difficulties in living up to the
aim of the club. In stories there are always poor
people whom one can benefit; patient sufferers at
hospitals, pallid children of the slums. But in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a><br /><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
range of Georgina's life there seemed to be so few
opportunities and those few did not always turn out
the way they should.</p>

<p>For instance, there was the time she tried to cheer
Tippy up with her "line to live by," and her efforts
were neither appreciated nor understood. And there
was the time only yesterday when she stayed with
Aunt Elspeth, and got into trouble with the eggs, and
now had a debt on her conscience equal to eight eggs
or twenty cents.</p>

<p>It showed how well Mr. Locke understood children
when he did not laugh over the recital of that
last calamity, although it sounded unspeakably funny
to him as Georgina told it. In such congenial company
the time flew so fast that Georgina was amazed
when Mr. Milford drove up to take his distinguished
guest away. Mr. Locke took with him what he
had hoped to get, a number of sketches to fill in at his
leisure.</p>

<p>"They're exactly what I wanted," he assured her
gratefully as he shook hands at parting. "And that
suggestion of yours for the ship will make the most
fetching illustration of all. I'll send you a copy in
oils when I get time for it, and I'll always think of
you, my little friend, as <i>Georgina of the Rainbows</i>."</p>

<p>With a courtly bow he was gone, and Georgina
went into the house to look for the little blank book
in which she had started to keep her two lists of
Club members, honorary and real. The name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Milford Norris Locke she wrote in both lists. If
there had been a third list, she would have written
him down in that as the very nicest gentleman she had
ever met. Then she began a letter to Barby, telling
all about her wonderful morning. But it seemed to
her she had barely begun, when Mr. Milford's chauffeur
came driving back with something for her in a
paper bag. When she peeped inside she was so astonished
she nearly dropped it.</p>

<p>"Eggs!" she exclaimed. Then in unconscious imitation
of Mrs. Saggs, she added, "Can you beat
<i>that!</i>"</p>

<p>One by one she took them out and counted them.
There were exactly eight. Then she read the card
which had dropped down to the bottom of the bag.</p>

<p>"Mr. Milford Norris Locke."</p>

<p>Above the name was a tiny rainbow done in water
colors, and below was scribbled the words, "Last
tag."</p>

<p>It was a pity that the new member could not
have seen her face at that instant, its expression was
so eloquent of surprise, of pleasure and of relief that
her trouble had thus been wiped out of existence.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LIGHT DAWNS FOR UNCLE DARCY</div>


<div class='cap'>FOR some time the faint jangle of a bell had been
sounding at intervals far down the street. Ordinarily
it would have caught Georgina's attention
long before this, but absorbed in the letter to which
she had returned after putting the eggs down cellar,
she did not hear the ringing until it was near
enough for the Towncrier's message to be audible
also. He was announcing the extra day of the Bazaar,
and calling attention to the many new attractions
it would have to offer on the morrow.</div>

<p>Instantly, Georgina dropped her pencil and flew
out to meet him. Here was an opportunity to find
out all about the Brewster trip. As he came towards
her she saw the same look in his weather-beaten old
face which she had wondered at the day before, when
he was bending over Aunt Elspeth, patting her on
the cheek. It was like the shining of a newly-lighted
candle.</p>

<p>She was not the only one who had noticed it. All
the way up the street glances had followed him. People
turned for a second look, wondering what good
fortune had befallen the old fellow. They had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to expect a cheery greeting from him. He always
left a kindly glow behind him whenever he passed.
But to-day the cheeriness was so intensified that he
seemed to be brimming over with good will to everybody.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Darcy!" cried Georgina. "You look
so happy!"</p>

<p>"Well, is it any wonder, lass, with such news from
Danny? Him alive and well and sure to come back
to me some of these days! I could hardly keep from
shouting it out to everybody as I came along the
street. I'm afraid it'll just naturally tell itself some
day, in spite of my promise to Belle. I'm glad I
can let off steam up here, you knowing the secret, too,
for this old heart of mine is just about to burst with
all the gladness that's inside of me."</p>

<p>Here was someone as anxious to tell as she was
to hear; someone who could recall every word of
the interview with the wild-cat woman. Georgina
swung on to his arm which held the bell, and began
to ask questions, and nothing loath, he let her lead
him into the yard and to the rustic seat running
around the trunk of the big willow tree. He was
ready to rest, now that his route was traveled and
his dollar earned.</p>

<p>Belle, back in the kitchen, preparing a light dinner
for herself and Georgina, Tippy being away for the
day, did not see him come in. She had not seen
him since the day the old rifle gave up its secret, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
she tried to put him out of her mind as much as
possible, for she was miserable every time she
thought of him. She would have been still more
miserable could she have heard all that he was saying
to Georgina.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Milford thought that the liniment folks
calling the boy 'Dave,' proved that he wasn't the
same as my Danny. But just one thing would have
settled all doubts for me if I'd a had any. That was
what he kept a calling in his fever when he was out
of his head: 'Belle mustn't suffer. Belle must be
spared, no matter what happens!'</p>

<p>"And that's the one thing that reconciles me to
keeping still a while longer. It was his wish to spare
her, and if he could sacrifice so much to do it, I can't
make his sacrifice seem in vain. I lay awake last
night till nearly daylight, thinking how I'd like to
take this old bell of mine, and go from one end of
the town to the other, ringing it till it cracked, crying
out, '<i>Danny is innocent</i>,' to the whole world.
But the time hasn't come yet. I'll have to be patient
a while longer and bear up the best I can."</p>

<p>Georgina, gazing fixedly ahead of her at nothing
in particular, pondered seriously for a long, silent
moment.</p>

<p>"If you did that," she said finally, "cried the good
news through the town till everybody knew&mdash;then
when people found out that it was Emmett Potter
who was the thief and that he was too much of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
coward to own up and take the blame&mdash;would they
let the monument go on standing there, that they'd
put up to show he was brave? It would serve him
right if they took it down, wouldn't it!" she exclaimed
with a savage little scowl drawing her brows together.</p>

<p>"No, no, child!" he said gently. "Give the lad
his due. He <i>was</i> brave that one time. He saved all
of those lives as it is chiseled on his headstone. It is
better he should be remembered for the best act in
his life than for the worst one. A man's measure
should be taken when he's stretched up to his full
height, just as far as he can lift up his head; not
when he's stooped to the lowest. It's only fair to
judge either the living or the dead that way."</p>

<p>For some time after that nothing more was said.
The harbor was full of boats this morning. It was
a sight worth watching. One naturally drifted into
day-dreams, following the sweep of the sails moving
silently toward the far horizon. Georgina was busy
picturing a home-coming scene that made the prodigal
son's welcome seem mild in comparison, when
Uncle Darcy startled her by exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, it <i>pays</i> to bear up and steer right onward!
S'pose I hadn't done that. S'pose I <i>hadn't</i> kept Hope
at the prow. I believe I'd have been in my grave
by this time with all the grief and worry. But
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and shook his head, unable to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
words to express the emotion which was making his
voice tremble and his face glow with that wonderful
inner shining. Georgina finished the sentence
for him, looking out on the sail-filled harbor and
thinking of the day he had taken her out in his boat
to tell her of his son.</p>

<p>"But now you'll be all ready and waiting when
your ship comes home from sea with its precious
cargo." They were his own words she was repeating.</p>

<p>"Danny'll weather the storms at last and come
into port with all flags flying."</p>

<p>The picture her words suggested was too much
for the old father. He put his hat up in front of his
face, and his shoulders shook with silent sobs. Georgina
laid a sympathetic little hand on the rough
sleeve next her. Suddenly the sails in the harbor
seemed to run together all blurry and queer. She
drew her hand across her eyes and looked again at
the heaving shoulders. A happiness so deep that it
found its expression that way, filled her with awe.
It must be the kind of happiness that people felt
when they reached "the shining shore, the other side
of Jordan," and their loved ones came down to welcome
them "into their desired haven."</p>

<p>That last phrase came to her lips like a bit of remembered
music and unconsciously she repeated it
aloud. Uncle Darcy heard it, and looked up. His
cheeks were wet when he put down his hat, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
was the happiest face she had ever seen, and there
was no shake in his voice now when he said solemnly:</p>

<p>"And nobody but the good Lord who's helped his
poor sailors through shipwreck and storm, knows
how mightily they've desired that haven, or what it
means to them to be brought into it."</p>

<p>A delivery wagon from one of the fruit stores
stopped in front of the gate, and the driver came in,
carrying a basket. Uncle Darcy spoke to him as he
passed the willow tree.</p>

<p>"Well, Joe, this looks like a chance for me to get
a lift most of the way home."</p>

<p>"Sure," was the cordial reply. "Climb in. I'll be
right back."</p>

<p>Georgina thought of something as he rose to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait just a minute, Uncle Darcy, I want to
get something of yours that's down cellar."</p>

<p>When she came back there was no time or opportunity
for an explanation. He and the driver
were both in the wagon. She reached up and put
the bag on the seat beside him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did something to some of your eggs, yesterday,"
she stammered, "and these are to take the
place of the ones I broke."</p>

<p>Uncle Darcy peered into the bag with a puzzled
expression. He had not missed any eggs from the
crock of bran. He didn't know what she was talking
about. But before he could ask any questions the
driver slapped the horse with the reins, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
rattling off down street. Georgina stood looking
after them a moment, then turned her head to listen.
Somebody was calling her. It was Belle, who
had come to the front door to say that dinner was
ready.</p>

<p>Whenever Mrs. Triplett was at home, Belle made
extra efforts to talk and appear interested in what
was going on around her. She was afraid her keen-eyed
Aunt Maria would see that she was unhappy.
But alone with Georgina who shared her secret, she
relapsed into a silence so deep it could be felt, responding
only with a wan smile when the child's
lively chatter seemed to force an answer of some
kind. But to-day when Georgina came to the table
she was strangely silent herself, so mute that Belle
noticed it, and found that she was being furtively
watched by the big brown eyes opposite her. Every
time Belle looked up she caught Georgina's gaze fastened
on her, and each time it was immediately transferred
to her plate.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Georgina?" she asked finally.
"Why do you keep staring at me?"</p>

<p>Georgina flushed guiltily. "Nothing," was the
embarrassed answer. "I was just wondering
whether to tell you or not. I thought maybe you'd
like to know, and maybe you ought to know, but I
wasn't sure whether you'd want me to talk to you
about it or not."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Belle put down her tea-cup. It was her turn to
stare.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake! What <i>are</i> you beating
around the bush about?"</p>

<p>"About the news from Danny," answered Georgina.
"About the letter he wrote to the wild-cat
woman and that got buried in the dunes too deep
ever to be dug up again."</p>

<p>As this was the first Belle had heard of either the
letter or the woman, her expression of astonishment
was all that Georgina could desire. Her news
had made a sensation. Belle showed plainly that
she was startled, and as eager to hear as Georgina
was to tell. So she began at the beginning, from the
time of the opening of the pouch on the Green
Stairs, to the last word of the wild-cat woman's conversation
which Uncle Darcy had repeated to her
only a few moments before under the willow.</p>

<p>Instinctively, she gave the recital a dramatic touch
which made Belle feel almost like an eye witness as
she listened. And it was with Uncle Darcy's own
gestures and manner that she repeated his final statement.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Milford thought the liniment folks calling
the boy Dave proved he wasn't the same as my
Danny. But just one thing would have settled all
doubts for me if I'd had any. That was what he
kept a calling in his fever when he was out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
head: '<i>Belle</i> mustn't suffer. <i>Belle</i> must be spared
no matter what happens.'"</p>

<p>At the bringing of her own name into the story
Belle gave a perceptible start and a tinge of red
crept into her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Did he say that, Georgina?" she demanded, leaning
forward and looking at her intently. "Are you
sure those are his exact words?"</p>

<p>"His very-own-exactly-the-same words," declared
Georgina solemnly. "I cross my heart and body
they're just as Uncle Darcy told them to me."</p>

<p>Rising from the table, Belle walked over to the
window and stood with her back to Georgina, looking
out into the garden.</p>

<p>"Well, and what next?" she demanded in a queer,
breathless sort of way.</p>

<p>"And then Uncle Darcy said that his saying that
was the one thing that made him feel willing to keep
still a while longer about&mdash;you know&mdash;what was in
the rifle. 'Cause if Danny cared enough about sparing
you to give up home and his good name and
everything else in life he couldn't spoil it all by telling
now. But Uncle Darcy said he lay awake nearly
all last night thinking how he'd love to take that old
bell of his and go ringing it through the town till it
cracked, calling out to the world, 'My boy is innocent.'</p>

<p>"And when I said something about it's all coming
out all right some day, and that Danny would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
weather the storms and come into port with all flags
flying&mdash;&mdash;" Here Georgina lowered her voice and
went on slowly as if she hesitated to speak of what
happened next&mdash;"he just put his old hat over his
face and cried. And I felt so sorry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Georgina's voice choked. There were tears in her
eyes as she spoke of the scene.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't!</i>" groaned Belle, her back still turned.</p>

<p>The note of distress in Belle's voice stilled Georgina's
lively tongue a few seconds, but there was one
more thing in her mind to be said, and with the persistence
of a mosquito she returned to the subject to
give that final stab, quite unconscious of how deeply
it would sting. She was only wondering aloud, something
which she had often wondered to herself.</p>

<p>"I should think that when anybody had suffered
as long as Danny has to spare you, it would make
you want to spare him. Doesn't it? I should think
that you'd want to do something to sort of make up
to him for it all. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't!</i>" exclaimed Belle again, sharply this
time. Then to Georgina's utter amazement she buried
her face in her apron, stood sobbing by the window
a moment, and ran out of the room. She did
not come downstairs again until nearly supper time.</p>

<p>Georgina sat at the table, not knowing what to
do next. She felt that she had muddled things dreadfully.
Instead of making Belle feel better as she
hoped to do, she realized she had hurt her in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
unintentional way. Presently, she slowly drew herself
up from her chair and began to clear the table,
piling the few dishes they had used, under the dishpan
in the sink. The house stood open to the summer
breeze. It seemed so desolate and deserted
with Belle upstairs, drawn in alone with her troubles
and Tippy away, that she couldn't bear to stay in the
silent rooms. She wandered out into the yard and
climbed up into the willow to look across the water.</p>

<p>Somewhere out there on those shining waves,
Richard was sailing along, in the party given for
Mr. Locke, and to-morrow he would be going away
on the yacht. If he were at home she wouldn't be
up in the willow wondering what to do next. Well,
as long as she couldn't have a good time herself
she'd think of someone else she could make happy.
For several minutes she sent her thoughts wandering
over the list of all the people she knew, but it
seemed as if her friends were capable of making
their own good times, all except poor Belle. Probably
<i>she</i> never would be happy again, no matter what
anybody did to try to brighten her life. It was so
discouraging when one was trying to play the game
of "Rainbow Tag," for there to be no one to tag.
She wished she knew some needy person, some unfortunate
soul who would be glad of her efforts to
make them happy.</p>

<p>Once she thought of slipping off down street to
the library. Miss Tupman always let her go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
where the shelves were and choose her own book.
Miss Tupman was always so interesting, too, more
than any of the books when she had time to talk.
But that grim old word Duty rose up in front of her,
telling her that she ought not to run away and leave
the house all open with Belle locked in her room upstairs.
Somebody ought to be within hearing if
the telephone rang or anyone came. She went
into the house for a book which she had read many
times but which never failed to interest her, and
curled up in a big rocking chair on the front porch.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon she smelled burning pine
chips and smoke from the kitchen chimney which
told that a fire was being started in the stove. After
a while she went around the house to the kitchen door
and peeped in, apprehensively. Belle was piling the
dinner dishes into the pan, preparatory to washing
them while supper was cooking. Her eyes were red
and she did not look up when Georgina came in, but
there was an air of silent determination about her
as forcible as her Aunt Maria's. Picking up the
tea-kettle, she filled the dishpan and carried the kettle
back to the stove, setting it down hard before she
spoke. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Nobody'll ever know what I've been through
with, fighting this thing out with myself. I can't go
all the way yet. I <i>can't</i> say the word that'll let the
blow fall on poor old Father Potter. But I don't
seem to care about my part of it any more. I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
things differently from what I did that first day&mdash;<i>you</i>
know. Even Emmett don't seem the same any
more."</p>

<p>For several minutes there was a rattling of dishes,
but no further speech from Belle. Georgina, not
knowing what to say or do, stood poised uncertainly
on the door-sill. Then Belle spoke again.</p>

<p>"I'm willing it should be told if only it could be
kept from getting back to Father Potter, for the
way Dan's done <i>does</i> make me want to set him square
with the world. I would like to make up to him in
some way for all he's suffered on my account. I
can't get over it that it was <i>him</i> that had all the
bravery and the nobleness that I was fairly worshiping
in Emmett all these years. Seems like the whole
world has turned upside down."</p>

<p>Georgina waited a long time, but Belle seemed to
have said all that she intended to say, so presently
she walked over and stood beside the sink.</p>

<p>"Belle," she said slowly, "does what you said
mean that you're really willing I should tell Barby?
Right away?"</p>

<p>Belle waited an instant before replying, then taking
a deep breath as if about to make a desperate
plunge into a chasm on whose brink she had long
been poised, said:</p>

<p>"Yes. Uncle Dan'l would rather have her know
than anybody else. He sets such store by her good
opinion. But oh, <i>do</i> make it plain it mustn't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
talked about outside, so's it'll get back to Father
Potter."</p>

<p>The next instant Georgina's arms were around
her in a silent but joyful squeeze, and she ran upstairs
to write to Barby before the sun should go
down or Tippy get back from the Bazaar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CONTRAST IN FATHERS</div>


<div class='cap'>GEORGINA was having a beautiful day. It was
the first time she had ever taken part in a Bazaar,
and so important was the role assigned her
that she was in a booth all by herself. Moreover,
the little mahogany chair in which she sat was on a
high platform inside the booth, so that all might behold
her. Dressed in a quaint old costume borrowed
from the chests in the Figurehead House, she represented
"A Little Girl of Long Ago."</div>

<p>On a table beside her stood other borrowed treasures
from the Figurehead House&mdash;a doll bedstead
made by an old sea captain on one of his voyages.
Each of its high posts was tipped with a white point,
carved from the bone of a whale. Wonderful little
patchwork quilts, a feather bed and tiny pillows
made especially for the bed, were objects of interest
to everyone who crowded around the booth. So
were the toys and dishes brought home from other
long cruises by the same old sea captain, who evidently
was an indulgent father and thought often
of the little daughter left behind in the home port.
A row of dolls dressed in fashions half a century old
were also on exhibition.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>With unfailing politeness Georgina explained to
the curious summer people who thronged around
her, that they all belonged in the house where the
figurehead of Hope sat on the portico roof, and
were not for sale at any price.</p>

<p>Until to-day Georgina had been unconscious that
she possessed any unusual personal charms, except
her curls. Her attention had been called to them
from the time she was old enough to understand remarks
people made about them as she passed along
the street. Their beauty would have been a great
pleasure to her if Tippy had not impressed upon her
the fact that looking in the mirror makes one vain,
and it's wicked to be vain. One way in which Tippy
guarded her against the sin of vanity was to mention
some of her bad points, such as her mouth being
a trifle too large, or her nose not quite so shapely as
her mother's, each time anyone unwisely called attention
to her "glorious hair."</p>

<p>Another way was to repeat a poem from a book
called "Songs for the Little Ones at Home," the
same book which had furnished the "Landing of the
Pilgrims" and "Try, Try Again." It began:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>What! Looking in the glass again?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why's my silly child so vain?"</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>The disgust, the surprise, the scorn of Tippy's
voice when she repeated that was enough to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
one hurry past a mirror in shame-faced embarrassment.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Beauty soon will fade away.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your rosy cheeks must soon decay.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There's nothing lasting you will find,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the treasures of the mind."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>Rosy cheeks might not be lasting, but it was certainly
pleasant to Georgina to hear them complimented
so continually by passers-by. Sometimes the
remarks were addressed directly to her.</p>

<p>"My <i>dear</i>," said one enthusiastic admirer, "if I
could only buy <i>you</i> and put you in a gold frame, I'd
have a prettier picture than any artist in town can
paint." Then she turned to a companion to add:</p>

<p>"Isn't she a love in that little poke bonnet with
the row of rose-buds inside the rim? I never saw
such exquisite coloring or such gorgeous eyes."</p>

<p>Georgina blushed and looked confused as she
smoothed the long lace mitts over her arms. But
by the time the day was over she had heard the sentiment
repeated so many times that she began to expect
it and to feel vaguely disappointed if it were
not forthcoming from each new group which approached
her.</p>

<p>Another thing gave her a new sense of pleasure
and enriched her day. On the table beside her, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
a glass case, to protect it from careless handling,
was a little blank book which contained the records
of the first sewing circle in Provincetown. The
book lay open, displaying a page of the minutes, and
a column of names of members, written in an exquisitely
fine and beautiful hand. The name of
Georgina's great-great grandmother was in that column.
It gave her a feeling of being well born and
distinguished to be able to point it out.</p>

<p>The little book seemed to reinforce and emphasize
the claims of the monument and the silver porringer.
She felt it was so nice to be beautiful and <i>to belong;</i>
to have belonged from the beginning both to a first
family and a first sewing circle.</p>

<p>Still another thing added to her contentment whenever
the recollection of it came to her. There was
no longer any secret looming up between her and
Barby like a dreadful wall. The letter telling all
about the wonderful and exciting things which had
happened in her absence was already on its way to
Kentucky. It was not a letter to be proud of. It
was scrawled as fast as she could write it with a
pencil, and she knew perfectly well that a dozen
or more words were misspelled, but she couldn't
take time to correct them, or to think of easy words
to put in their places. But Barby wouldn't care.
She would be so happy for Uncle Darcy's sake and
so interested in knowing that her own little daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
had had an important part in finding the good news
that she wouldn't notice the spelling or the scraggly
writing.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, Georgina, growing more and
more satisfied with herself and her lot, felt that there
was no one in the whole world with whom she would
change places. Towards the last of the afternoon
a group of people came in whom Georgina recognized
as a family from the Gray Inn. They had
been at the Inn several days, and she had noticed
them each time she passed them, because the children
seemed on such surprisingly intimate terms with
their father. That he was a naval officer she knew
from the way he dressed, and that he was on a long
furlough she knew from some remark which she
overheard.</p>

<p>He had a grave, stern face, and when he came into
the room he gave a searching glance from left to
right as if to take notice of every object in it. His
manner made Georgina think of "Casabianca," another
poem of Tippy's teaching:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i><span style="margin-left: 7em;">"He stood</span><br />
As born to rule the storm.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A creature of heroic blood,</span><br />
A brave though ... form.</i>"<br />
</div>

<p>"Childlike" was the word she left out because it
did not fit in this case. "A brave and manlike form"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
would be better. She repeated the verse to herself
with this alteration.</p>

<p>When he spoke to his little daughter or she spoke
to him his expression changed so wonderfully that
Georgina watched him with deep interest. The oldest
boy was with them. He was about fourteen and
as tall as his mother. He was walking beside her
but every few steps he turned to say something to
the others, and they seemed to be enjoying some
joke together. Somebody who knew them came up
as they reached the booth of "The Little Girl of
Long Ago," and introduced them to Georgina, so
she found out their names. It was Burrell. He
was a Captain, and the children were Peggy and
Bailey.</p>

<p>As Georgina looked down at Peggy from the little
platform where she sat in the old mahogany chair,
she thought with a throb of satisfaction that she
was glad she didn't have to change places with that
homely little thing. Evidently, Peggy was just up
from a severe illness. Her hair had been cut so
short one could scarcely tell the color of it. She
was so thin and white that her eyes looked too large
for her face and her neck too slender for her head,
and the freckles which would scarcely have shown
had she been her usual rosy self, stood out like big
brown <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'spotches'">splotches</ins> on her pallid little face. She limped
a trifle too, as she walked.</p>

<p>With a satisfied consciousness of her own rose-leaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
complexion, Georgina was almost patronizing
as she bent over the table to say graciously once more
after countless number of times, "no, that is not for
sale."</p>

<p>The next instant Peggy was swinging on her father's
arm exclaiming, "Oh, Dad-o'-my-heart! See that
cunning doll bathing suit. Please get it for me."
Almost in the same breath Bailey, jogging the Captain's
elbow on the other side, exclaimed, "Look,
Partner, <i>that's</i> a relic worth having."</p>

<p>Georgina listened, fascinated. To think of calling
one's father "Dad-o'-my-heart" or "Partner!"
And they looked up at him as if they adored him,
even that big boy, nearly grown. And a sort of
laugh come into the Captain's eyes each time they
spoke to him, as if he thought everything they said
and did was perfect.</p>

<p>A wave of loneliness swept over Georgina as she
listened. There was an empty spot in her heart that
ached with longing&mdash;not for Barby, but for the
father whom she had never known in this sweet intimate
way. She knew now how it felt to be an orphan.
What satisfaction was there in having
beautiful curls if no big, kind hand ever passed over
them in a fatherly caress such as was passing over
Peggy Burrell's closely-clipped head? What pleasure
was there in having people praise you if they
said behind your back:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Justin Huntingdon's daughter. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
you think a man would want to come home once or
twice in a lifetime to such a lovely child as that?"</p>

<p>Georgina had heard that very remark earlier in
the day, also the answer given with a significant shrug
of the shoulders:</p>

<p>"Oh, he has other fish to fry."</p>

<p>The remarks had not annoyed her especially at the
time, but they rankled now as she recalled them.
They hurt until they took all the pleasure and satisfaction
out of her beautiful day, just as the sun, going
under a cloud, leaves the world bereft of all its
shine and sparkle. She looked around, wishing it
were time to go home.</p>

<p>Presently, Captain Burrell, having made the
rounds of the room, came back to Georgina. He
smiled at her so warmly that she wondered that she
could have thought his face was stern.</p>

<p>"They tell me that you are Doctor Huntingdon's
little girl," he said with a smile that went straight
to her heart. "So I've come back to ask you all
about him. Where is he now and how is he? You
see I have an especial interest in your distinguished
father. He pulled me through a fever in the Philippines
that all but ended me. I have reason to remember
him for his many, many kindnesses to me at
that time."</p>

<p>The flush that rose to Georgina's face might naturally
have been taken for one of pride or pleasure,
but it was only miserable embarrassment at not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
able to answer the Captain's questions. She
could not bear to confess that she knew nothing of
her father's whereabouts except the vague fact that
he was somewhere in the interior of China, and that
there had been no letter from him for months and
that she had not seen him for nearly four years.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he was well the last time we heard from
him," she managed to stammer. "But I haven't
heard anything lately. You know my mother isn't
home now. She went to Kentucky because my grandfather
Shirley was hurt in an accident."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that," was the answer in
a cordial, sympathetic voice. "I hoped to have the
pleasure of meeting her and I wanted Mrs. Burrell
to know her, too. But I hope you'll come over to
the Inn and play with Peggy sometimes. We'll be
here another week."</p>

<p>Georgina thanked him in her prettiest manner, but
she was relieved when he passed on, and she was
freed from the fear of any more embarrassing questions
about her father. Yet her hand still tingled
with the friendliness of his good-bye clasp, and she
wished that she could know him better. As she
watched him pass out of the door with Peggy holding
his hand and swinging it as they walked, she
thought hungrily:</p>

<p>"How good it must seem to have a father like
<i>that</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Triplett came up to her soon after. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
time to close the Bazaar. The last probable customer
had gone, and the ladies in charge of the
booths were beginning to dismantle them. Someone's
chauffeur was waiting to take Georgina's costume
back to the Figurehead House.</p>

<p>She followed Mrs. Triplett obediently into an
improvised dressing-room in the corner, behind a
tall screen, and in a very few minutes was about to
emerge clad in her own clothes, when Mrs. Triplett
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"For pity sakes! Those gold beads!"</p>

<p>Georgina's hand went up to the string of gold
beads still around her neck. They also were borrowed
from Mrs. Tupman of the Figurehead House.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask Mrs. Tupman to take them
home herself," said Mrs. Triplett, "but she left
earlier than I thought she would, and I had no chance
to say anything about them. We oughtn't to trust
anything as valuable as gold beads that are an heirloom
to any outsider, no matter how honest. They
might be lost. Suppose you just <i>wear</i> them home
to her. Do you feel like doing that? And keep
them on your neck till she unclasps them with her
own hands. Don't leave them with a servant."</p>

<p>Georgina, tired of sitting all day in the booth, was
glad of an excuse for a long walk. It was almost
six o'clock, but the sun was still high. As she went
along, jostled off the narrow sidewalk and back on
to it again every few steps by the good-natured crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
which swarmed the streets at this hour, she could
smell supper cooking in the houses along the way.
It would be delayed in many homes because the tide
was in and people were running down the beach
from the various cottages for a dip into the sea.
Some carried their bathing suits in bundles, some
wore them under raincoats or dressing gowns, and
some walked boldly along bare-armed and bare-legged
in the suits themselves.</p>

<p>It was a gay scene, with touches of color in every
direction. Vivid green grass in all the door-yards,
masses of roses and hollyhocks and clematis against
the clean white of the houses. Color of every shade
in the caps and sweaters and bathing suits and floating
motor veils and parasols, jolly laughter everywhere,
and friendly voices calling back and forth
across the street. It was a holiday town full of
happy holiday people.</p>

<p>Georgina, skipping along through the midst of it,
added another pretty touch of color to the scene, with
her blue ribbons and hat with the forget-me-nots
around it, but if her thoughts could have been seen,
they would have showed a sober drab. The meeting
with Captain Burrell had left her depressed and
unhappy. The thought uppermost in her mind was
why should there be such a difference in fathers?
Why should Peggy Burrell have such an adorable
one, and she be left to feel like an orphan?</p>

<p>When she reached the Figurehead House she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
told that Mrs. Tupman had stepped out to a neighbor's
for a few minutes but would be right back.
She could have left the beads with a member of the
family, but having been told to deliver them into
the hands of the owner only, she sat down in the
swing in the yard to wait.</p>

<p>From where she sat she could look up at the
figurehead over the portico. It was the best opportunity
she had ever had for studying it closely. Always
before she had been limited to the few seconds
that were hers in walking or driving by. Now she
could sit and gaze at it intently as she pleased.</p>

<p>The fact that it was weather-stained and dark as
an Indian with the paint worn off its face in patches,
only enhanced its interest in her eyes. It seemed
to bear the scars of one who has suffered and come
up through great tribulation. No matter how battered
this Lady of Mystery was in appearance, to
Georgina she still stood for "Hope," clinging to her
wreath, still facing the future with head held high,
the symbol of all those, who having ships at sea,
watch and wait for their home-coming with proud,
undaunted courage.</p>

<p>Only an old wooden image, but out of a past of
shipwreck and storm its message survived and in
some subtle manner found its way into the heart of
Georgina.</p>

<p>"And I'll do it, too," she resolved valiantly, looking
up at it. "I'm going to hope so hard that he'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
be the way I want him to be, that he'll just <i>have</i> to.
And if he isn't&mdash;then I'll just steer straight onward
as if I didn't mind it, so Barby'll never know how
disappointed I am. Barby must never know that."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the gold beads being delivered
into Mrs. Tupman's own hands, Georgina took
her way homeward, considerably lighter of heart,
for those moments of reflection in the swing. As
she passed the antique shop a great gray cat on the
door-step, rose and stretched itself.</p>

<p>"Nice kitty!" she said, stopping to smooth the
thick fur which stood up as he arched his back.</p>

<p>It was "Grandpa," to whose taste for fish she
owed her prism and the bit of philosophy which was
to brighten not only her own life but all those which
touched hers. But she passed on, unconscious of her
debt to him.</p>

<p>When she reached the Gray Inn she walked more
slowly, for on the beach back of it she saw several
people whom she recognized. Captain Burrell was
in the water with Peggy and Bailey and half a dozen
other children from the Inn. They were all splashing
and laughing. They seemed to be having some
sort of a game. She stood a moment wishing that
she had on her bathing suit and was down in the
water with them. She could swim better than any
of the children there. But she hadn't been in the
sea since Barby left. That was one of the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
she promised in their dark hour of parting, not to
go in while Barby was gone.</p>

<p>While she stood there, Mrs. Burrell came out on
the piazza of the Inn, followed by the colored nurse
with the baby who was just learning to walk. The
Captain, seeing them, threw up his hand to signal
them. Mrs. Burrell fluttered her handkerchief in
reply.</p>

<p>Georgina watched the group in the water a moment
longer, then turned and walked slowly on. She
felt that if she could do it without having to give up
Barby, she'd be willing to change places with Peggy
Burrell. She'd take her homely little pale, freckled
face, straight hair and&mdash;yes, even her limp, for the
right to cling to that strong protecting shoulder as
Peggy was doing there in the water, and to whisper
in his ear, "Dad-o'-my-heart."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LETTER TO HONG-KONG</div>


<div class='cap'>THERE are some subjects one hesitates to discuss
with one's family. It is easier to seek
information from strangers or servants, who do not
feel free to come back at you with the disconcerting
question, "But why do you ask?"</div>

<p>It was with the half-formed resolution of leading
up to a certain one of these difficult subjects if she
could, that Georgina wandered down the beach next
morning to a little pavilion near the Gray Inn. It
was occupied by Peggy Burrell, her baby brother and
the colored nurse Melindy.</p>

<p>Georgina, sorely wanting companionship now that
Richard and Captain Kidd were off on their yachting
trip, was thankful that Mrs. Triplett had met
Captain Burrell the day before at the Bazaar, and
had agreed with him that Georgina and Peggy ought
to be friends because their fathers were. Otherwise,
the occupants of the pavilion would have been
counted as undesirable playmates being outside the
pale of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>Peggy welcomed her joyfully. She wasn't strong
enough yet to go off on a whole morning's fishing
trip with brother and Daddy, she told Georgina, and
her mother was playing bridge on the hotel piazza.
Peggy was a little thing, only eight, and Georgina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
not knowing what to do to entertain her, resurrected
an old play that she had not thought of for several
summers. She built Grandfather Shirley's house in
the sand.</p>

<p>It took so long to find the right kind of shells
with which to make the lanterns for the gate-posts,
and to gather the twigs of bayberry and beach plum
for the avenues (she had to go into the dunes for
them), that the question she was intending to ask
Melindy slipped from her mind for a while. It
came back to her, however, as she scooped a place
in the wall of pebbles and wet sand which stood for
the fence.</p>

<p>"Here's the place where the postman drops the
mail."</p>

<p>Then she looked up at Melindy, the question on
the tip of her tongue. But Peggy, on her knees, was
watching her so intently that she seemed to be looking
straight into her mouth every time it opened,
and her courage failed her. Instead of saying what
she had started to say, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here's the hole in the fence where the little pigs
squeezed through." Then she told the story that
went with this part of the game. When it was time
to put in the bee-hives, however, and Peggy volunteered
to look up and down the beach for the right
kind of a pebble to set the bee-hives on, Georgina
took advantage of the moment alone with Melindy.
There wasn't time to lead up to the question properly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
There wasn't even time to frame the question
in such a way that it would seem a casual, matter-of-course
one. Georgina was conscious that the
blood was surging up into her cheeks until they must
seem as red as fire. She leaned forward toward the
sand-pile she was shaping till her curls fell over her
face. Then she blurted out:</p>

<p>"How often do husbands write to wives?"</p>

<p>Melindy either did not hear or did not understand,
and Georgina had the mortifying experience
of repeating the question. It was harder to give
utterance to it the second time than the first. She
was relieved when Melindy answered without showing
any surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, most every week I reckon, when they
loves 'em. Leastways white folks do. It comes easy
to them to write. An' I lived in one place where the
lady got a lettah every othah day."</p>

<p>"But I mean when the husband's gone for a long,
long time, off to sea or to another country, and is
dreadfully busy, like Captain Burrell is when he's
on his ship."</p>

<p>Melindy gave a short laugh. "Huh! Let me tell
you, honey, when a man <i>wants</i> to write he's gwine
to write, busy or no busy."</p>

<p>Later, Georgina went home pondering Melindy's
answer. "Most every week when they love's 'em.
Sometimes every other day." And Barby had had
no letter for over four months.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Something happened that afternoon which had
never happened before in all Georgina's experience.
She was taken to the Gray Inn to call. Mrs. Triplett,
dressed in her new black summer silk, took her.</p>

<p>"As long as Barbara isn't here to pay some attention
to that Mrs. Burrell," Tippy said to Belle,
"it seems to me it's my place as next of kin. The
Captain couldn't get done saying nice things about
Justin."</p>

<p>Evidently, she approved of both Mrs. Burrell and
Peggy, for when each begged that Georgina be allowed
to stay to supper she graciously gave permission.</p>

<p>"Peggy has taken the wildest fancy to you, dear,"
Mrs. Burrell said in an aside to Georgina. "You
gave her a beautiful morning on the beach. The
poor little thing has suffered so much with her lame
knee, that we are grateful to anyone who makes her
forget all that she has gone through. It's only last
week that she could have the brace taken off. She
hasn't been able to run and play like other children
for two years, but we're hoping she may outgrow the
trouble in time."</p>

<p>The dining-room of the Gray Inn overlooked the
sea, and was so close to the water one had the feeling
of being in a boat, when looking out of its windows.
There were two South American transports
in the harbor. Some of the officers had come ashore
and were dining with friends at the Gray Inn. Afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
they stayed to dance a while in the long
parlor with the young ladies of the party.</p>

<p>Peggy and Georgina sat on the piazza just outside
one of the long French windows, where they
could watch the gay scene inside. It seemed almost
as gay outside, when one turned to look across the
harbor filled with moving lights. Captain and Mrs.
Burrell were outside also. They sat farther down
the piazza, near the railing, talking to one of the
officers who was not dancing. Once when the music
stopped, Peggy turned to Georgina to say:</p>

<p>"Do you hear Daddy speaking Spanish to that
officer from South America? Doesn't he do it well?
I can understand a little of what they say because
we lived in South America a while last year. We
join him whenever he is stationed at a port where
officers can take their families. He says that children
of the navy have to learn to be regular gypsies.
I love going to new places. How many languages
can your father speak?"</p>

<p>Georgina, thus suddenly questioned, felt that she
would rather die than acknowledge that she knew so
little of her father that she could not answer. She
was saved the mortification of confessing it, however,
by the music striking up again at that moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can play that!" she exclaimed. "That's
the dance of the tarantula. Isn't it a weird sort of
thing?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The air of absorbed interest with which Georgina
turned to listen to the music made Peggy forget her
question, and listen in the same way. She wanted
to do everything in the same way that Georgina did
it, and from that moment that piece of music held
special charm for her because Georgina called it
weird.</p>

<p>The next time Georgina glanced down the piazza
Mrs. Burrell was alone. In her dimly-lighted corner,
she looked like one of the pretty summer girls
one sees sometimes on a magazine cover. She was
all in white with a pale blue wrap of some kind about
her that was so soft and fleecy it looked like a pale
blue cloud. Georgina found herself looking down
that way often, with admiring glances. She happened
to have her eyes turned that way when the Captain
came back and stood beside her chair. The blue
wrap had slipped from her shoulders without her
notice, and he stooped and picked it up. Then he
drew the soft, warm thing up around her, and bending
over, laid his cheek for just an instant against
hers.</p>

<p>It was such a fleeting little caress that no one saw
it but Georgina, and she turned her eyes away instantly,
feeling that she had no right to look, yet
glad that she had seen, because of the warm glow
it sent through her. She couldn't tell why, but somehow
the world seemed a happier sort of place for
everybody because such things happened in it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," she thought wistfully, as her eyes
followed the graceful steps of the foreign dancers
and her thoughts stayed with what she had just
witnessed, "I wonder if that had been Barby and my
father, would <i>he?</i>"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But she did not finish even to herself the question
which rose up to worry her. It came back every
time she recalled the little scene.</p>

<p>On the morning after her visit to the Gray Inn
she climbed up on the piano stool when she had finished
practising her scales. She wanted a closer
view of the portrait which hung over it. It was an
oil painting of her father at the age of five. He
wore kilts and little socks with plaid tops, and he
carried a white rabbit in his arms. Georgina knew
every inch of the canvas, having admired it from the
time she was first held up to it in someone's arms to
"see the pretty bunny." Now she looked at it long
and searchingly.</p>

<p>Then she opened the book-case and took out an
old photograph album. There were several pictures
of her father in that. One taken with his High
School class, and one with a group of young medical
students, and one in the white service dress of an
assistant surgeon of the navy. None of them corresponded
with her dim memory of him.</p>

<p>Then she went upstairs to Barby's room, and stood
before the bureau, studying the picture upon it in
a large silver frame. It was taken in a standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
position and had been carefully colored, so that she
knew accurately every detail of the dress uniform
of a naval surgeon from the stripes of gold lace and
maroon velvet on the sleeves, to the eagle on the belt
buckle and the sword knot dangling over the scabbard.
There were various medals pinned on his
breast which had always interested her.</p>

<p>But this morning it was not the uniform or the
decorations which claimed her attention. It was the
face itself. She was looking for something in the
depths of those serious dark eyes, that she had seen
in Captain Burrell's when he looked at Peggy; something
more than a smile, something that made his
whole face light up till you felt warm and happy just
to look at him. She wondered if the closely-set
lips she was studying could curve into a welcoming
smile if anybody ran to meet him with happy outstretched
arms. But the picture was baffling and disappointing,
because it was a profile view.</p>

<p>Presently, she picked it up and carried it to her
own room, placing it on the table where she always
sat to write. She had screwed up her courage at
last, to the point of writing the letter which long
ago she had decided ought to be written by somebody.</p>

<p>Once Barby said, "When you can't think of anything
to put in a letter, look at the person's picture,
and pretend you're talking to it." Georgina followed
that advice now. But one cannot talk enthusiastically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to a listener who continues to show
you only his profile.</p>

<p>Suddenly, her resentment flamed hot against this
handsome, averted face which was all she knew of a
father. She thought bitterly that he had no business
to be such a stranger to her that she didn't even
know what he looked like when he smiled. Something
of the sternness of her old Pilgrim forbears
crept into her soul as she sat there judging him and
biting the end of her pen. She glanced down at
the sheet of paper on which she had painstakingly
written "Dear Father." Then she scratched out
the words, feeling she could not honestly call him
that when he was such a stranger. Taking a clean
sheet of paper, she wrote even more painstakingly:</p>

<p>"Dear Sir: There are two reesons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she looked up in doubt about the spelling
of that last word. She might have gone downstairs
and consulted the dictionary but her experience had
proved that a dictionary is an unsatisfactory book
when one does not know how to spell a word. It is
by mere chance that what one is looking for can be
found. After thinking a moment she put her head
out of the window and called softly down to Belle,
who was sewing on the side porch. She called softly
so that Tippy could not hear and answer and maybe
add the remark, "But why do you ask? Are you
writing to your mother?"</p>

<p>Belle spelled the word for her, and taking another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
sheet of paper Georgina made a fresh start. This
time she did not hesitate over the spelling, but scribbled
recklessly on until all that was crowding up
to be said was on the paper.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir: There are two reasons for writing
this. One is about your wife. Cousin Mehitable
says something is eating her heart out, and I thought
you ought to know. Maybe as you can cure so many
strange diseeses you can do something for her. The
other is to ask you to send us another picture of
yourself. The only ones we have of you are looking
off sideways, and I can't feel as well acquainted
with you as if I could look into your eyes.</p>

<p>"There is a lovely father staying at the Gray Inn.
He is Peggy Burrell's. He is a naval officer, too.
It makes me feel like an orfan when I see him going
down the street holding her hand. He asked me to
tell him all about where you are and what you are
doing, because you cured him once on a hospital
ship, and I was ashamed to tell him that I didn't
know because Barby has not had a letter from you
for over four months. Please don't let on to her
that I wrote this. She doesn't know that I was
under the bed when Cousin Mehitable was talking
about you, and saying that everybody thinks it is
queer you never come home. If you can do only
one of the things I asked, please do the first one.
Yours truly, Georgina Huntingdon."</p>

<p>Having blotted the letter, Georgina read it over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
carefully, finding two words that did not look quite
right, although she did not know what was the matter
with them. So she called softly out of the window
again to Belle:</p>

<p>"How do you spell diseases?"</p>

<p>Belle told her but added the question, "Why do
you ask a word like that? Whose diseases can you
be writing about?"</p>

<p>Georgina drew in her head without answering.
She could not seek help in that quarter again, especially
for such a word as "orfan." After studying
over it a moment she remembered there was a poem
in "Songs for the Little Ones at Home," called "The
Orphan Nosegay Girl."</p>

<p>A trip downstairs for the tattered volume gave
her the word she wanted, and soon the misspelled
one was scratched out and rewritten. There were
now three unsightly blots on the letter and she hovered
over them a moment, her pride demanding that
she should make a clean, fair copy. But it seemed
such an endless task to rewrite it from beginning to
end, that she finally decided to send it as it stood.</p>

<p>Addressed, stamped and sealed, it was ready at
last and she dropped it into the mail-box. Then
she had a moment of panic. It was actually started
on its way to Hong-Kong and nothing in her power
could stop it or bring it back. She wondered if she
hadn't done exactly the wrong thing, and made a
bad matter worse.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PEGGY JOINS THE RAINBOW-MAKERS</div>


<div class='cap'>ONLY one more thing happened before Barby's
return that is worth recording. Georgina went
to spend the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'way'">day</ins> at the Gray Inn. Captain Burrell,
himself, came to ask her. Peggy had to be put back
into her brace again he said. He was afraid it had
been taken off too soon. She was very uncomfortable
and unhappy on account of it. They would be
leaving in the morning, much earlier than they had
intended, because it was necessary for her physician
to see her at once, and quite probable that she would
have to go back to the sanitarium for a while. She
didn't want to leave Provincetown, because she did
not want to go away from Georgina.</div>

<p>"You have no idea how she admires you," the
Captain added, "or how she tries to copy you. Her
dream of perfect happiness is to look and act just
like you. Yesterday she made her mother tie a big
pink bow on her poor little cropped head because
you passed by wearing one on your curls. You can
cheer her up more than anyone else in the world."</p>

<p>So Georgina, touched both by the Captain's evident
distress over Peggy's returning lameness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Peggy's fondness for her, went gladly. The knowledge
that everything she said and did was admired,
made it easy for her to entertain the child, and the
pity that welled up in her heart every time she
watched the thin little body move around in the tiresome
brace, made her long to do something that
would really ease the burden of such a misfortune.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burrell was busy packing all morning, and
in the afternoon went down the street to do some
shopping that their hurried departure made necessary.
Peggy brought out her post-card album, in
which to fasten all the postals she had added to her
collection while on the Cape. Among them was one
of the Figurehead House, showing "Hope" perched
over the portico.</p>

<p>"Bailey says that's a sea-cook," Peggy explained
gravely. "A sea-cook who was such a wooden-head
that when he made doughnuts they turned green.
He's got one in his hand that he's about to heave
into the sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, horrors! No!" exclaimed Georgina, as scandalized
as if some false report had been circulated
about one of her family.</p>

<p>"That is Hope with a wreath in her hand, looking
up with her head held high, just as she did when
she was on the prow of a gallant ship. Whenever
I have any trouble or disappointment I think of her,
and she helps me to bear up and be brave, and go
on as if nothing had happened."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"How?" asked Peggy, gazing with wondering
eyes at the picture of the figurehead, which was too
small on the postal to be very distinct. Anything
that Georgina respected and admired so deeply,
Peggy wanted to respect and admire in the same
way, but it was puzzling to understand just what it
was that Georgina saw in that wooden figure to make
her feel so. Accustomed to thinking of it in Bailey's
way, as a sea-cook with a doughnut, it was hard to
switch around to a point of view that showed it as
Hope with a wreath, or to understand how it could
help one to be brave about anything.</p>

<p>Something of her bewilderment crept into the
wondering "why," and Georgina hesitated, a bit puzzled
herself. It was hard to explain to a child two
years younger what had been taught to her by the
old Towncrier.</p>

<p>"You wait till I run home and get my prism,"
she answered. "Then I can show you right away,
and we can play a new kind of tag game with it."</p>

<p>Before Peggy could protest that she would rather
have her question unanswered than be left alone,
Georgina was off and running up the beach as fast
as her little white shoes could carry her. Her cheeks
were as red as the coral necklace she wore, when she
came back breathless from her flying trip.</p>

<p>There followed a few moments of rapture for
Peggy, when the beautiful crystal pendant was placed
in her own hands, and she looked through it into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
world transformed by the magic of its coloring.
She saw the room changed in a twinkling, as when
a fairy wand transforms a mantle of homespun to
cloth-of-gold. Through the open window she saw
an enchanted harbor filled with a fleet of rainbows.
Every sail was outlined with one, every mast edged
with lines of red and gold and blue. And while she
looked, and at the same time listened, Georgina's
explanation caught some of the same glamor, and
sank deep into her tender little heart.</p>

<p>That was the way that <i>she</i> could change the world
for people she loved&mdash;put a rainbow around their
troubles by being so cheery and hopeful that everything
would be brighter just because she was there.
To keep Hope at the prow simply meant that she
mustn't get discouraged about her knee. No matter
how much it hurt her or the brace bothered her,
she must bear up and steer right on. To do that
bravely, without any fretting, was the surest way in
the world to put a rainbow around her father's
troubles.</p>

<p>Thus Georgina mixed her "line to live by" and her
prism philosophy, but it was clear enough to the
child who listened with heart as well as ears. And
clear enough to the man who sat just outside the
open window on the upper porch, with his pipe, listening
also as he gazed off to sea.</p>

<p>"The poor little lamb," he said to himself. "To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
think of that baby trying to bear up and be brave on
<i>my</i> account! It breaks me all up."</p>

<p>A few minutes later as he started across the hall,
Peggy, seeing him pass her door, called to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy! Come look through this wonderful
fairy glass. You'll think the whole world is bewitched."</p>

<p>She was lying back in a long steamer chair, and impatient
to reach him, she started to climb out as he
entered the room. But she had not grown accustomed
to the brace again, and she stumbled clumsily
on account of it. He caught her just in time to save
her from falling, but the prism, the shining crystal
pendant, dropped from her hands and struck the
rocker of a chair in its fall to the floor.</p>

<p>She gave a frightened cry, and stood holding her
breath while Georgina stooped and picked it up.
It was in two pieces now. The long, radiant point,
cut in many facets like a diamond, was broken off.</p>

<p>Georgina, pale and trembling at this sudden destruction
of her greatest treasure, turned her back,
and for one horrible moment it was all she could do
to keep from bursting out crying. Peggy, seeing her
turn away and realizing all that her awkwardness
was costing Georgina, buried her face on her father's
shoulder and went into such a wild paroxysm of sobbing
and crying that all his comforting failed to comfort
her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I'd <i>died</i> first," she wailed. "She'll
never love me again. She said it was her most precious
treasure, and now I've broken it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, there," soothed the Captain, patting
the thin little arm reached up to cling around
his neck. "Georgina knows it was an accident. She's
going to forgive my poor little Peggykins for what
she couldn't help. She doesn't mind its being broken
as much as you think."</p>

<p>He looked across at Georgina, appealingly, helplessly.
Peggy's grief was so uncontrollable he was
growing alarmed. Georgina wanted to cry out:</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>do</i> mind! How can you say that? I can't
stand it to have my beautiful, beautiful prism
ruined!"</p>

<p>She was only a little girl herself, with no comforting
shoulder to run to. But something came to her
help just then. She remembered the old silver porringer
with its tall, slim-looped letters. She remembered
there were some things she could not do. She
<i>had</i> to be brave now, because her name had been
written around that shining rim through so many
brave generations. She could not deepen the hurt of
this poor little thing already nearly frantic over what
she had done. Tippy's early lessons carried her
gallantly through now. She ran across the room to
where Peggy sat on her father's knee, and put an
arm around her.</p>

<p>"Listen, Peggy," she said brightly. "There's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
piece of prism for each of us now. Isn't that nice?
You take one and I'll keep the other, and that will
make you a member of our club. We call it the
Rainbow Club, and we're running a race seeing who
can make the most bright spots in the world, by making
people happy. There's just four members in it
so far; Richard and me and the president of the
bank and Mr. Locke, the artist, who made the pictures
in your blue and gold fairy-tale book. And
you can be the fifth. But you'll have to begin this
minute by stopping your crying, or you can't belong.
What did I tell you about fretting?"</p>

<p>And Peggy stopped. Not instantly, she couldn't
do that after such a hard spell. The big sobs kept
jerking her for a few minutes no matter how hard
she tried to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stiffle'">stifle</ins> them; but she sat up and let her
father wipe her face on his big handkerchief, and
she smiled her bravest, to show that she was worthy
of membership in the new club.</p>

<p>The Captain suddenly drew Georgina to his other
knee and kissed her.</p>

<p>"You blessed little rainbow maker!" he exclaimed.
"I'd like to join your club myself. What a happy
world this would be if everybody belonged to it."</p>

<p>Peggy clasped her hands together beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> let him belong, Georgina. I'll lend
him my piece of prism half the time."</p>

<p>"Of course he can," consented Georgina. "But he
can belong without having a prism. Grown people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
don't need anything to help them remember about
making good times in the world."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said the Captain, as if he were talking
to himself. Georgina, looking at him shyly from
the corner of her eye, wondered what it was he wondered.</p>

<p>It was almost supper time when she went home.
She had kept the upper half of the prism which had
the hole in it, and it dangled from her neck on the
pink ribbon as she walked.</p>

<p>"If only Barby could have seen it first," she
mourned. "I wouldn't mind it so much. But she'll
never know how beautiful it was."</p>

<p>But every time that thought came to her it was
followed by a recollection which made her tingle
with happiness. It was the Captain's deep voice saying
tenderly, "You blessed little rainbow-maker!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A MODERN "ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON"</div>


<div class='cap'>BARBY was at home again. Georgina, hearing
the jangle of a bell, ran down the street to meet
the old Towncrier with the news. She knew now,
how he felt when he wanted to go through the town
ringing his bell and calling out the good tidings
about his Danny to all the world. That's the way
she felt her mother's home-coming ought to be proclaimed.
It was such a joyful thing to have her back
again.</div>

<p>And Grandfather Shirley wasn't going to be blind,
Georgina confided in her next breath. The sight of
both eyes would be all right in time. They were so
thankful about that. And Barby had brought her
the darlingest little pink silk parasol ever made or
dreamed of, all the way from Louisville, and some
beaten biscuit and a comb of honey from the beehives
in her old home garden.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how much news Georgina managed
to crowd into the short time that it took to
walk back to the gate. The Burrells had left town
and Belle had gone home, and Richard had sent her
a postal card from Bar Harbor with a snapshot of
himself and Captain Kidd on it. And&mdash;she lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
her voice almost to a whisper as she told the
next item:</p>

<p>"Barby knows about Danny! Belle said I might
tell her if she'd promise not to let it get back to Mr.
Potter."</p>

<p>They had reached the house by this time, and
Georgina led him in to Barby who rose to welcome
him with both hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Darcy," she exclaimed. "I know&mdash;and
I'm <i>so</i> glad. And Justin will be, too. I sent
Georgina's letter to him the very day it came. I
knew he'd be so interested, and it can do no harm
for him to know, away off there in the interior of
China."</p>

<p>Georgina was startled, remembering the letter
which <i>she</i> had sent to the interior of China. Surely
her father wouldn't send that back to Barby! Such
a panic seized her at the bare possibility of such a
thing, that she did not hear Uncle Darcy's reply.
She wondered what Barby would say if it should
come back to her. Then she recalled what had happened
the first few moments of Barby's return and
wondered what made her think of it.</p>

<p>Barby's first act on coming into the house, was
to walk over to the old secretary where the mail
was always laid, and look to see if any letters were
waiting there for her. And that was before she
had even stopped to take off her veil or gloves.
There were three which had arrived that morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
but she only glanced at them and tossed them aside.
The one she wanted wasn't there. Georgina had
turned away and pretended that she wasn't watching,
but she was, and for a moment she felt that
the sun had gone behind a cloud, Barby looked
so disappointed.</p>

<p>But it was only for a moment, for Barby immediately
began to tell about an amusing experience
she had had on her way home, and started upstairs
to take off her hat, with Georgina tagging after to
ask a thousand questions, just as she had been tagging
ever since.</p>

<p>And later she had thrown her arms around her
mother, exclaiming as she held her fast, "You haven't
changed a single bit, Barby," and Barby answered
gaily:</p>

<p>"What did you expect, dearest, in a few short
weeks? White hair and spectacles?"</p>

<p>"But it doesn't seem like a few short weeks,"
sighed Georgina. "It seems as if years full of things
had happened, and that I'm as old as you are."</p>

<p>Now as Uncle Darcy recounted some of these
happenings, and Barby realized how many strange
experiences Georgina had lived through during her
absence, how many new acquaintances she had made
and how much she had been allowed to go about
by herself, she understood why the child felt so
much older. She understood still better that night
as she sat brushing Georgina's curls. The little girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
on the footstool at her knee was beginning to reach
up&mdash;was beginning to ask questions about the strange
grown-up world whose sayings and doings are always
so puzzling to little heads.</p>

<p>"Barby," she asked hesitatingly, "what do people
mean exactly, when they say they have other
fish to fry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just other business to attend to or something
else they'd rather do."</p>

<p>"But when they shrug their shoulders at the same
time," persisted Georgina.</p>

<p>"A shrug can stand for almost anything," answered
Barby. "Sometimes it says meaner things
than words can convey."</p>

<p>Then came the inevitable question which made
Georgina wish that she had not spoken.</p>

<p>"But why do you ask, dear? Tell me how the expression
was used, and I can explain better."</p>

<p>Now Georgina could not understand why she had
brought up the subject. It had been uppermost in
her mind all evening, but every time it reached the
tip of her tongue she drove it back. That is, until
this last time. Then it seemed to say itself. Having
gone this far she could not lightly change the subject
as an older person might have done. Barby
was waiting for an answer. It came in a moment,
halting but truthful.</p>

<p>"That day I was at the Bazaar, you know, and
everybody was saying how nice I looked, dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
up like a little girl of long ago, I heard Mrs. Whitman
say to Miss Minnis that one would think that
Justin Huntingdon would want to come home once
or twice in a lifetime to see me; and Miss Minnis
shrugged her shoulders, this way, and said:</p>

<p>"'Oh, he has other fish to fry.'"</p>

<p>Georgina, with her usual aptitude for mimicry,
made the shrug so eloquent that Barby understood
exactly what Miss Minnis intended to convey, and
what it had meant to the wondering child.</p>

<p>"Miss Minnis is an old cat!" she exclaimed impatiently.
Then she laid down the brush, and gathering
Georgina's curls into one hand, turned her
head so that she could look into the troubled little
face.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Baby," she demanded. "Have you
heard anyone else say things like that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Georgina, "several times. And
yesterday a woman who came into the bakery while
I was getting the rolls Tippy sent me for, asked me
if I was Doctor Huntingdon's little girl. And when
I said yes, she asked me when he was coming home."</p>

<p>"And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought she hadn't any right to ask, specially
in the way she made her question sound. She
doesn't belong in this town, anyhow. She's only one
of the summer boarders. So I drew myself up the
way the Duchess always did in 'The Fortunes of
Romney Tower.' Don't you remember? and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
said, 'It will probably be some time, Madam.' Then
I took up my bag of hot rolls and marched out. I
think that word Madam always sounds so freezing,
when you say it the way the Duchess was always doing."</p>

<p>"Oh, you ridiculous baby!" exclaimed Barby,
clasping her close and kissing her again and again.
Then seeing the trouble still lingering in the big
brown eyes, she took the little face between her hands
and looked into it long and intently, as if reading
her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Georgina," she said presently, "I understand
now, what is the matter. You're wondering the same
thing about your father that these busybodies are.
It's my fault though. I took it for granted that
you understood about his long absence. I never
dreamed that it was hurting you in any way."</p>

<p>Georgina hid her face in Barby's lap, her silence
proof enough that her mother had guessed aright.
For a moment or two Barby's hand strayed caressingly
over the bowed head. Then she said:</p>

<p>"I wonder if you remember this old story I used
to tell you, beginning, 'St. George of Merry England
was the youngest and the bravest of the seven
champions of Christendom. Clad in bright armor
with his magic sword Ascalon by his side, he used
to travel on his war horse in far countries in search
of adventure.' Do you remember that?"</p>

<p>Georgina nodded yes without raising her head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you remember he came to a beach where
the Princess Saba called to him to flee, because the
Dragon, the most terrible monster ever seen on
earth, was about to come up out of the sea and destroy
the city. Every year it came up to do this,
and only the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden could
stop it from destroying the people.</p>

<p>"But undismayed, Saint George refused to flee.
He stayed on and fought the dragon, and wounded
it, and bound it with the maiden's sash and led it
into the market place where it was finally killed.
And the people were forever freed from the terrible
monster because of his prowess. Do you remember
all that?"</p>

<p>Again Georgina nodded. She knew the story well.
Every Christmas as far back as she could remember
she had eaten her bit of plum pudding from a
certain rare old blue plate, on which was the picture
of Saint George, the dragon and the Princess.</p>

<p>"Nowadays," Barby went on, "because men do not
ride around 'clad in bright armor,' doing knightly
deeds, people do not recognize them as knights. But
your father is doing something that is just as great
and just as brave as any of the deeds of any knight
who ever drew a sword. Over in foreign ports
where he has been stationed, is a strange disease
which seems to rise out of the marshes every year,
just as the dragon did, and threaten the health and
the lives of the people. It is especially bad on ship-board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and it is really harder to fight than a real
dragon would be, because it is an invisible foe, a
sickness that comes because of a tiny, unseen microbe.</p>

<p>"Your father has watched it, year after year, attacking
not only the sailors of foreign navies but
our own men, when they have to live in those ports,
and he made up his mind to go on a quest for this
invisible monster, and kill it if possible. It is such
a very important quest that the Government was
glad to grant him a year's leave of absence from the
service.</p>

<p>"He was about to come home to see us first, when
he met an old friend, a very wealthy Englishman,
who has spent the greater part of his life collecting
rare plants and studying their habits. He has written
several valuable books on Botany, and the last
ten years he has been especially interested in the
plants of China. He was getting ready to go to the
very places that your father was planning to visit,
and he had with him an interpreter and a young
American assistant. When he invited your father to
join him it was an opportunity too great to be refused.
This Mr. Bowles is familiar with the country
and the people, even speaks the language himself
a little. He had letters to many of the high
officials, and could be of the greatest assistance to
your father in many ways, even though he did not
stay with the party. He could always be in communication
with it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"So, of course, he accepted the invitation. It is
far better for the quest and far better for himself
to be with such companions.</p>

<p>"I am not uneasy about him, knowing he has
friends within call in case of sickness and accident,
and he will probably be able to accomplish his purpose
more quickly with the help they will be able to
give. You know he has to go off into all sorts of
dirty, uncomfortable places, risk his own health and
safety, go among the sick and suffering where he
can watch the progress of the disease under different
conditions.</p>

<p>"The whole year may be spent in a vain search,
with nothing to show for it at the end, and even if
he is successful and finds the cause of this strange illness
and a remedy, his only reward will be the satisfaction
of knowing he has done something to relieve
the suffering of his fellow-creatures. People
can understand the kind of bravery that shows. If
he were rescuing one person from a burning house
or a sinking boat they would cry out, 'What a hero.'
But they don't seem to appreciate this kind of rescue
work. It will do a thousand times more good,
because it will free the whole navy from the teeth
of the dragon.</p>

<p>"If there were a war, people would not expect him
to come home. We are giving him up to his country
now, just as truly as if he were in the midst of battle.
A soldier's wife and a soldier's daughter&mdash;it is the
proof of our love and loyalty, Georgina, to bear his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
long absence cheerfully, no matter how hard that is
to do; to be proud that he can serve his country if
not with his sword, with the purpose and prowess of
a Saint George."</p>

<p>Barby's eyes were wet but there was a starry light
in them, as she lifted Georgina's head and kissed her.
Two little arms were thrown impulsively around her
neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Barby! I'm so sorry that I didn't know all
that before! I didn't understand, and I felt real
ugly about it when I heard people whispering and
saying things as if he didn't love us any more. And&mdash;when
I said my prayers at bedtime&mdash;I didn't sing
'Eternal Father Strong to Save' a single night while
you were gone."</p>

<p>Comforting arms held her close.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you write and tell mother about it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want to make you feel bad. I was afraid
from what Cousin Mehitable said you were going
to <i>die</i>. I worried and worried over it. Oh, I had
the miserablest time!"</p>

<p>Another kiss interrupted her. "But you'll never
do that way again, Georgina. Promise me that no
matter what happens you'll come straight to me
and have it set right."</p>

<p>The promise was given, with what remorse and
penitence no one could know but Georgina, recalling
the letter she had written, beginning with a stern
"Dear Sir." But to justify herself, she asked after
the hair-brushing had begun again:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Barby, why has he stayed away from home
four whole years? He wasn't hunting dragons before
this, was he?"</p>

<p>"No, but I thought you understood that, too. He
didn't come back here to the Cape because there were
important things which kept him in Washington during
his furloughs. Maybe you were too small to remember
that the time you and I were spending the
summer in Kentucky he had planned to join us there.
But he wired that his best friend in the Navy, an old
Admiral, was at the point of death, and didn't want
him to leave him. The Admiral had befriended him
in so many ways when he first went into the service
that there was nothing else for your father to do but
stay with him as long as he was needed. You were
only six then, and I was afraid the long, hot trip
might make you sick, so I left you with mamma while
I went on for several weeks. Surely you remember
something of that time."</p>

<p>"No, just being in Kentucky is all I remember,
and your going away for a while."</p>

<p>"And the next time some business affairs of his
own kept him in Washington, something very important.
You were just getting over the measles
and I didn't dare take you, so you stayed with Tippy.
So you see it wasn't your father's fault that he didn't
see you. He had expected you to be brought down
to Washington."</p>

<p>Georgina pondered over the explanation a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
then presently said with a sigh, "Goodness me, how
easy it is to look at things the wrong way."</p>

<p>Soon after her voice blended with Barby's in a
return to the long neglected bedtime rite:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For those in peril on the sea."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>Afterward, her troubles all smoothed and explained
away, she lay in the dark, comforted and
at peace with the world. Once a little black doubt
thrust its head up like a snake, to remind her of
Melindy's utterance, "When a man <i>wants</i> to write,
he's gwine to write, busy or no busy." But even
that found an explanation in her thoughts.</p>

<p>Of course, Melindy meant just ordinary men.
Not those who had great deeds to do in the world
like her father. Probably Saint George himself
hadn't written to his family often, if he had a family.
He couldn't be expected to. He had "other fish
to fry," and it was perfectly right and proper for
him to put his mind on the frying of them to the neglect
of everything else.</p>

<p>The four months' long silence was unexplained
save for this comforting thought, but Georgina worried
about it no longer. Up from below came the
sound of keys touched softly as Barby sang an old
lullaby. She sang it in a glad, trustful sort of way.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>He is far across the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But he's coming home to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Baby mine!</span></i>"
</div>

<p>Lying there in the dark, Georgina composed another
letter to send after her first one, and next
morning this is what she wrote, sitting up in the
willow tree with a magazine on her knees for a writing
table:</p>

<p>"Dearest Father: I am sorry that I wrote that last
letter, because everything is different from what I
thought it was. I did not know until Barby came
home and told me, that you are just as brave as St.
George was, clad in bright armor, when he went to
rescue the people from the dragon. I hope you get
the monster that comes up out of the sea every year
after the poor sailors. Barby says we are giving
you to our country in this way, as much as if there
was war, so now I'm prouder of having a St.-George-and-the-dragon-kind
of a father than one like
Peggy Burrell's, even if she does know him well
enough to call him 'Dad-o'-my-heart.' Even if people
don't understand, and say things about your never
coming home to see us, we are going to 'still bear
up and steer right onward,' because that's our line
to live by. And we hope as hard as we can every
day, that you'll get the mike-robe you are in kwest of.
Your loving little daughter, Georgina Huntingdon."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DOCTOR'S DISCOVERY</div>


<div class='cap'>IN due time the letter written in the willow tree
reached the city of Hong-Kong, and was carried
to the big English hotel, overlooking the loveliest
of Chinese harbors. But it was not delivered to
Doctor Huntingdon. It was piled on top of all the
other mail which lay there, awaiting his return.
Under it was Georgina's first letter to him and the
one she had written to her mother about Dan Darcy
and the rifle. And under that was the one which
Barbara called the "rainbow letter," and then at
least half a dozen from Barbara herself, with the
beautiful colored photograph of the Towncrier and
his lass. Also there were several bundles of official-looking
documents and many American newspapers.</div>

<p>Nothing had been forwarded to him for two
months, because he had left instructions to hold his
mail until further notice. The first part of that time
he was moving constantly from one out-of-the-way
place to another where postal delivery was slow and
uncertain. The last part of that time he was lying
ill in the grip of the very disease which he had gone
out to study and to conquer.</p>

<p>He was glad then to be traveling in the wake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the friendly old Englishman and his party. Through
their interpreter, arrangements were made to have
him carried to one of the tents of a primitive sort
of a hospital, kept by some native missionaries.
The Englishman's young assistant went with him.
He was a quiet fellow whom Mr. Bowles had jokingly
dubbed David the silent, because it was so hard
to make him talk. But Doctor Huntingdon, a reserved,
silent man himself, had been attracted to him
by that very trait.</p>

<p>During the months they had been thrown together
so much, Dave had taken great interest in the Doctor's
reports of the experiments he was making in
treating the disease. When the Doctor was told
that Mr. Bowles had gone back to the coast, having
found what he wanted and made his notes for his
next book, and consequently Dave was free to stay
and nurse him, he gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Dave stopped his thanks almost gruffly.</p>

<p>"There's more than one reason for my staying,"
he said. "I've been sick among strangers in a strange
country, myself, and I know how it feels. Besides,
I'm interested in seeing if this new treatment of
yours works out on a white man as well as it did on
these natives. I'll be doing as much in the way of
scientific research, keeping a chart on you, as if I
were taking notes for Mr. Bowles."</p>

<p>That was a long speech for Dave, the longest that
he made during the Doctor's illness. But in the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
which followed, one might well have wondered if
there was not a greater reason than those he offered
for such devoted attendance. He was always within
call, always so quick to notice a want that usually a
wish was gratified before it could be expressed. His
was a devotion too constant to be prompted merely
by sympathy for a fellow-country-man or interest in
medical experiments.</p>

<p>Once, when the Doctor was convalescing, he
opened his eyes to find his silent attendant sitting beside
him reading, and studied him for some time,
unobserved.</p>

<p>"Dave," he said, after watching him a while&mdash;"it's
the queerest thing&mdash;lately every time I look at you
I'm reminded of home. You must resemble someone
I used to know back there, but for the life of me
I can't recall who."</p>

<p>Dave answered indifferently, without glancing up
from the page.</p>

<p>"There's probably a thousand fellows that look
like me. I'm medium height and about every third
person you see back in the States has gray eyes like
mine, and just the ordinary every-day sort of features
that I have."</p>

<p>The Doctor made no answer. It never would have
occurred to him to tell Dave in what way his face
differed from the many others of his type. There
was a certain kindliness of twinkle in the gray eyes
at times, and always a straightforward honesty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
gaze that made one instinctively trust him. There
was strength of purpose in the resolute set of his
mouth, and one could not imagine him being turned
back on any road which he had made up his mind to
travel to the end.</p>

<p>Several days after that when the Doctor was sitting
up outside the tent, the resemblance to someone
whom he could not recall, puzzled him again. Dave
was whittling, his lips pursed up as he whistled softly
in an absent-minded sort of way.</p>

<p>"Dave," exclaimed the Doctor, "there's something
in the way you sit there, whittling and whistling that
brings little old Provincetown right up before my
eyes. I can see old Captain Ames sitting there on
the wharf on a coil of rope, whittling just as you
are doing, and joking with Sam and the crew as they
pile into the boat to go out to the weirs. I can see
the nets spread out to dry alongshore, and smell tar
and codfish as plain as if it were here right under
my nose. And down in Fishburn Court there's the little
house that was always a second home to me, with
Uncle Darcy pottering around in the yard, singing
his old sailors' songs."</p>

<p>The Doctor closed his eyes and drew in a long,
slow breath.</p>

<p>"Um! There's the most delicious smell coming
out of that kitchen&mdash;blueberry pies that Aunt Elspeth's
baking. What wouldn't I give this minute for
one of those good, juicy blueberry pies of hers, smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
hot. I can smell it clear over here in China.
There never was anything in the world that tasted
half so good. I was always tagging around after
Uncle Darcy, as I called him. He was the Towncrier,
and one of those staunch, honest souls who
make you believe in the goodness of God and man
no matter what happens to shake the foundations of
your faith."</p>

<p>The Doctor opened his eyes and looked up inquiringly,
startled by the knocking over of the stool
on which Dave had been sitting. He had risen abruptly
and gone inside the tent.</p>

<p>"Go on," he called back. "I can hear you."</p>

<p>He seemed to be looking for something, for he was
striding up and down in its narrow space. The Doctor
raised his voice a trifle.</p>

<p>"That's all I had to say. I didn't intend to bore
you talking about people and places you never heard
of. But it just came over me in a big wave&mdash;that
feeling of homesickness that makes you feel you've
got to get back or die. Did you ever have it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came the answer in an indifferent tone.
"Several times."</p>

<p>"Well, it's got me now, right by the throat."</p>

<p>Presently he called, "Dave, while you're in there
I wish you'd look in my luggage and see what newspapers
are folded up with it. I have a dim recollection
that a <i>Provincetown Advocate</i> came about
the time I was taken sick and I never opened it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, that's it!" he exclaimed when Dave emerged
presently, holding out the newspaper. "Look at the
cut across the top of the first page. Old Provincetown
itself. It's more for the name of the town
printed across that picture of the harbor than for the
news that I keep on taking the paper. Ordinarily,
I never do more than glance at the news items, but
there's time to-day to read even the advertisements.
You've no idea how good those familiar old names
look to me."</p>

<p>He read some of them aloud, smiling over the
memories they awakened. But he read without an
auditor, for Dave found he had business with one
of the missionaries, and put off to attend to it. On
his return he was greeted with the announcement:</p>

<p>"Dave, I want to get out of here. I'm sure there
must be a big pile of mail waiting for me right now
in Hong-Kong, and I'm willing to risk the trip. Let's
start back to-morrow."</p>

<p>Several days later they were in Hong-Kong, enjoying
the luxuries of civilization in the big hotel.
Still weak from his recent illness and fatigued by
the hardships of his journey, Doctor Huntingdon
did not go down to lunch the day of their arrival.
It was served in his room, and as he ate he stopped
at intervals to take another dip into the pile of mail
which had been brought up to him.</p>

<p>In his methodical way he opened the letters in the
order of their arrival, beginning with the one whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
postmark showed the earliest date. It took a long
time to finish eating on account of these pauses. Hop
Ching was bringing in his coffee when Dave came
back, having had not only his lunch in the dining-room,
but a stroll through the streets afterward.
He found Doctor Huntingdon with a photograph
propped up in front of him, studying it intently while
Hop Ching served the coffee. The Doctor passed
the photograph to Dave.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/i025.jpg" width="388" height="600" alt="the Town Crier and his lass" />
</div>

<p>"Take it over to the window where you can get a
good light on it," he commanded. "Isn't that a
peach of a picture? That's my little daughter and
the old friend I'm always quoting. The two seem
to be as great chums as he and I used to be. I don't
want to bore you, Dave, but I would like to read you
this letter that she wrote to her mother, and her
mother sent on to me. In the first place I'm proud
of her writing such a letter. I had no idea she could
express herself so well, and secondly the subject matter
makes it an interesting document.</p>

<p>"On my little girl's birthday Uncle Darcy took
her out in his boat, <i>The Betsey</i>. The name of that
old boat certainly does sound good to me! He told
her&mdash;but wait! I'd rather read it to you in her own
words. It'll give you such a good idea of the old
man. Perhaps I ought to explain that he had a son
who got into trouble some ten years ago, and left
home. He was just a little chap when I saw him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
last, hardly out of dresses, the fall I left home for
college.</p>

<p>"Uncle Darcy and Aunt Elspeth were fairly foolish
about him. He had come into their lives late,
you see, after their older children died. I don't believe
it would make any difference to them what he'd
do. They would welcome him back from the very
gallows if he'd only come. His mother never has
believed he did anything wrong, and the hope of the
old man's life is that his 'Danny,' as he calls him,
will make good in some way&mdash;do something to wipe
out the stain on his name and come back to him."</p>

<p>The Doctor paused as if waiting for some encouragement
to read.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Dave. "I'd like to hear it, best in
the world."</p>

<p>He turned his chair so that he could look out of
the window at the harbor. The Chinese sampans
of every color were gliding across the water like a
flock of gaily-hued swans. He seemed to be dividing
his attention between those native boats and the
letter when the Doctor first began to read. It was
Georgina's rainbow letter, and the colors of the rainbow
were repeated again and again by the reds and
yellows and blues of that fleet of sampans.</p>

<p>But as the Doctor read on Dave listened more intently,
so intently, in fact, that he withdrew his attention
entirely from the window, and leaning forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
buried his face in his hands, his elbows resting
on his knees. The Doctor found him in this attitude
when he looked up at the end, expecting some
sort of comment. He was used to Dave's silences,
but he had thought this surely would call forth some
remark. Then as he studied the bowed figure, it
flashed into his mind that the letter must have
touched some chord in the boy's own past. Maybe
Dave had an old father somewhere, longing for his
return, and the memory was breaking him all up.</p>

<p>Silently, the Doctor turned aside to the pile of letters
still unread. Georgina's stern little note beginning
"Dear Sir" was the next in order and was in
such sharp contrast to the loving, intimate way she
addressed her mother, that he felt the intended reproach
of it, even while it amused and surprised him.
But it hurt a little. It wasn't pleasant to have his
only child regard him as a stranger. It was fortunate
that the next letter was the one in which she
hastened to call him "a Saint-George-and-the-dragon
sort of father."</p>

<p>When he read Barbara's explanation of his long
silence and Georgina's quick acceptance of it, he
wanted to take them both in his arms and tell them
how deeply he was touched by their love and loyalty;
that he hadn't intended to be neglectful of them or so
absorbed in his work that he put it first in his life.
But it was hard for him to put such things into words,
either written or spoken. He had left too much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
be taken for granted he admitted remorsefully to
himself.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat staring sternly into space.
So people had been gossiping about him, had they?
And Barbara and the baby had heard the whispers
and been hurt by them&mdash;&mdash;He'd go home and put a
stop to it. He straightened himself up and turned
to report his sudden decision to Dave. But the chair
by the window was empty. The Doctor glanced over
his shoulder. Dave had changed his seat and was
sitting behind him. They were back to back, but a
mirror hung in such a way the Doctor could see
Dave's face.</p>

<p>With arms crossed on a little table in front of
him, he was leaning forward for another look at the
photograph which he had propped up against a vase.
A hungry yearning was in his face as he bent towards
it, gazing into it as if he could not look his
fill. Suddenly his head went down on his crossed
arms in such a hopeless fashion that in a flash
Doctor Huntingdon divined the reason, and recognized
the resemblance that had haunted him. Now
he understood why the boy had stayed behind to
nurse him. Now a dozen trifling incidents that had
seemed of no importance to him at the time, confirmed
his suspicion.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to cry out "<i>Dan!</i>" but his
life-long habit of repression checked him. He felt
he had no right to intrude on the privacy which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
boy guarded so jealously. But Uncle Darcy's son!
Off here in a foreign land, bowed down with remorse
and homesickness! How he must have been tortured
with all that talk of the old town and its
people!</p>

<p>A great wave of pity and yearning tenderness
swept through the Doctor's heart as he sat twisted
around in his chair, staring at that reflection in the
mirror. He was uncertain what he ought to do. He
longed to go to him with some word of comfort, but
he shrank from the thought of saying anything
which would seem an intrusion.</p>

<p>Finally he rose, and walking across the room, laid
his hand on the bowed shoulder with a sympathetic
pressure.</p>

<p>"Look here, my boy," he said, in his deep, quiet
voice. "I'm not asking you what the trouble is, but
whatever it is you'll let me help you, won't you?
You've given me the right to ask that by all you've
done for me. Anything I could do would be only
too little for one who has stood by me the way you
have. I want you to feel that I'm your friend in the
deepest meaning of that word. You can count on me
for anything." Then in a lighter tone as he gave the
shoulder a half-playful slap he added, "I'm <i>for</i> you,
son."</p>

<p>The younger man raised his head and straightened
himself up in his chair.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be!" he exclaimed, "if you knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
who I am." Then he blurted out the confession:
"I'm Dan Darcy. I can't let you go on believing in
me when you talk like that."</p>

<p>"But I knew it when I said what I did," interrupted
Doctor Huntingdon. "It flashed over me
first when I saw you looking at your father's picture.
No man could look at a stranger's face that way.
Then I knew what the resemblance was that has
puzzled me ever since I met you. The only wonder
to me is that I did not see it long ago."</p>

<p>"You knew it," repeated Dan slowly, "and yet
you told me to count you as a friend in the deepest
meaning of that word. How could you mean it?"</p>

<p>The Doctor's answer came with deep impressiveness.</p>

<p>"Because, despite whatever slip you may have
made as a boy of eighteen, you have grown into a
man worthy of such a friendship. A surgeon in my
position learns to read character, learns to know an
honest man when he sees one. No matter what lies
behind you that you regret, I have every confidence
in you now, Dan. I am convinced you are worthy
to be the son of even such a man as Daniel Darcy."</p>

<p>He held out his hand to have it taken in a long,
silent grip that made it ache.</p>

<p>"Come on and go back home with me," urged the
Doctor. "You've made good out here. Do the
brave thing now and go back and live down the past.
It'll make the old folks so happy it'll wipe out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
heart-break of all those years that you've been
away."</p>

<p>Dan's only response was another grasp of the
Doctor's hand as strong and as painful as the first.
Pulling himself up by it he stood an instant trying
to say something, then, too overcome to utter a word,
made a dash for the door.</p>

<p>Doctor Huntingdon was so stirred by the scene
that he found it difficult to go back to his letters, but
the very next one in order happened to be the one
Georgina wrote to her mother just after Belle had
given her consent to Barby's being told of Emmett's
confession. He read the latter part of it, standing,
for he had sprung to his feet with the surprise of its
opening sentence. He did not even know that Emmett
had been dead all these years, and Dan, who
had had no word from home during all his absence,
could not know it either. He was in a tremor of
eagerness to hurry to him with the news, but he
waited to scan the rest of the letter.</p>

<p>Then with it fluttering open in his hand he strode
across the hall and burst into Dan's room without
knocking.</p>

<p>"Pack up your junk, this minute, boy," he shouted.
"We take the first boat out of here for home. Look
at this!"</p>

<p>He thrust Georgina's letter before Dan's bewildered
eyes.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHILE THEY WAITED</div>


<div class='cap'>"THERE comes the boy from the telegraph
office." Mrs. Triplett spoke with such a
raven-like note of foreboding in her voice that Georgina,
practising her daily scales, let her hands fall
limply from the keys.</div>

<p>"The Tishbite!" she thought uneasily. What evil
was it about to send into the house now, under cover
of that yellow envelope? Would it take Barby
away from her as it had done before?</p>

<p>Sitting motionless on the piano stool, she waited
in dread while Mrs. Triplett hurried to the door before
the boy could ring, signed for the message and
silently bore it upstairs. The very fact that she
went up with it herself, instead of calling to Barby
that a message had come, gave Georgina the impression
that it contained bad news.</p>

<p>"A <i>cablegram</i> for me?" she heard Barby ask.
Then there was a moment's silence in which she
knew the message was being opened and read. Then
there was a murmur as if she were reading it aloud
to Tippy and then&mdash;an excited whirlwind of a Barby
flying down the stairs, her eyes like happy stars, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
arms outstretched to gather Georgina into them, and
her voice half laugh, half sob, singing:</p>

"<i>Oh, he's coming home to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Baby mine!"</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>Never before had Georgina seen her so radiant,
so excited, so overflowingly happy that she gave vent
to her feelings as a little schoolgirl might have done.
Seizing Georgina in her arms she waltzed her around
the room until she was dizzy. Coming to a pause
at the piano stool she seated herself and played,
"The Year of Jubilee Has Come," in deep, crashing
chords and trickly little runs and trills, till the
old tune was transformed into a paen of jubilation.</p>

<p>Then she took the message from her belt, where
she had tucked it and re-read it to assure herself of
its reality.</p>

<p>"Starting home immediately. Stay three months,
dragon captured."</p>

<p>"That must mean that his quest has been fairly
successful," she said. "If he's found the cause of
the disease it'll be only a matter of time till he finds
how to kill it."</p>

<p>Then she looked up, puzzled.</p>

<p>"How strange for him to call it the <i>dragon</i>.
How could he know we'd understand, and that we've
been calling it that?"</p>

<p>Georgina's time had come for confession.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I wrote him a little note after you told me
the story and told him I was proud of having a
Saint-George-kind of a father, and that we hoped
every day he'd get the microbe."</p>

<p>"You darling!" exclaimed Barbara, drawing her
to her for another impulsive hug. She did not ask
as Georgina was afraid she would:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you were writing to your
father?" Barbara understood, without asking, remembering
the head bowed in her lap after that confession
of her encounter with the prying stranger in
the bakery.</p>

<p>Suddenly Georgina asked:</p>

<p>"Barby, what is the 'Tishbite?'"</p>

<p>"The what?" echoed Barby, wrinkling her forehead
in perplexity.</p>

<p>"The <i>Tishbite</i>. Don't you know it says in the
Bible, Elijah and the Tishbite&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear, you've turned it around, and put
the and in the wrong place. It is '<i>And</i> Elijah the
Tishbite,' just as we'd say William the Norman or
Manuel the Portuguese."</p>

<p>"Well, for pity sakes!" drawled Georgina in a
long, slow breath of relief. "Is <i>that</i> all? I wish I'd
known it long ago. It would have saved me a lot of
scary feelings."</p>

<p>Then she told how she had made the wish on the
star and tried to prove it as Belle had taught her, by
opening the Bible at random.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you had read on," said Barby, "you'd have
found what it meant your own self."</p>

<p>"But the book shut up before I had a chance," explained
Georgina. "And I never could find the place
again, although I've hunted and hunted. And I
was sure it meant some sort of devil, and that it
would come and punish me for using the Bible that
way as if it were a hoodoo."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you ask me?" insisted Barby.
"There's another time you see, when a big worry
and misunderstanding could have been cleared away
with a word. To think of your living in dread all
that time, when the Tishbite was only a good old
prophet whose presence brought a blessing to the
house which sheltered him."</p>

<p>That night when Georgina's curls were being
brushed she said, "Barby, I know now who my
Tishbite is; it's Captain Kidd. He's brought a
blessing ever since he came to this town. If it hadn't
been for his barking that day we were playing in
the garage I wouldn't be here now to tell the tale.
If it hadn't been for him I wouldn't have known
Richard, and we'd never have started to playing
pirate. And if we hadn't played pirate Richard
wouldn't have asked to borrow the rifle, and if he
hadn't asked we never would have found the note
hidden in the stock, and if we hadn't found the note
nobody would have known that Danny was innocent.
Then if Captain Kidd hadn't found the pouch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
we wouldn't have seen the compass that led to finding
the wild-cat woman who told us that Danny was
alive and well."</p>

<p>"What a House-That-Jack-Built sort of tale that
was!" exclaimed Barby, much amused. "We'll have
to do something in Captain Kidd's honor. Give him
a party perhaps, and light up the holiday tree."</p>

<p>The usual bedtime ceremonies were over, and
Barby had turned out the light and reached the door
when Georgina raised herself on her elbow to call:</p>

<p>"Barby, I've just thought of it. The wish I made
on that star that night is beginning to come true.
Nearly everybody I know is happy about something."
Then she snuggled her head down on the pillow
with a little wriggle of satisfaction. "Ugh! this is
such a good world. I'm so glad I'm living in it.
Aren't you?"</p>

<p>And Barby had to come all the way back in the
dark to emphasize her heartfelt "yes, indeed," with
a hug, and to seal the restless eyelids down with a
kiss&mdash;the only way to make them stay shut.</p>

<p>Richard came back the next day. He brought a
picture to Georgina from Mr. Locke. It was the
copy of the illustration he had promised her, the
fairy shallop with its sails set wide, coming across
a sea of Dreams, and at the prow, white-handed
Hope, the angel girt with golden wings, which swept
back over the sides of the vessel.</p>

<p>"Think of having a painting by the famous Milford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Norris Locke!" exclaimed Barby. She hung
over it admiringly. "Most people would be happy
to have just his autograph." She bent nearer to examine
the name in the corner of the picture. "What's
this underneath? Looks like number IV."</p>

<p>"Oh, that means he's number four in our Rainbow
Club. Peggy Burrell is number five and the
Captain is number six. That's all the members we
have so far."</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to count me in?" asked Barby.</p>

<p>"Oh, you <i>are</i> counted in. You've belonged from
the beginning. We made you an <i>honary</i> member
or whatever it is they call it, people who deserve to
belong because they're always doing nice things,
but don't know it. There's you and Uncle Darcy
and Captain Kidd, because he saved our lives and
saved our families from having to have a double
funeral."</p>

<p>Barby stooped to take the little terrier's head between
her hands and pat-a-cake it back and forth
with an affectionate caress.</p>

<p>"Captain Kidd," she said gaily, "you shall have
a party this very night, and there shall be bones and
cakes on the holiday tree, and you shall be the best
man with a 'normous blue bow on your collar, and
we'll all dance around in your honor this way."</p>

<p>Springing to her feet and holding the terrier's
front paws, she waltzed him around and around on
his hind legs, singing:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>All around the barberry bush,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Barberry bush, barberry bush.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All around the barberry bush</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So early in the morning."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>Georgina, accustomed all her life to such frisky
performances, took it as a matter of course that
Barby should give vent to her feelings in the same
way that she herself would have done, but Richard
stood by, bewildered. It was a revelation to him
that anybody's mother could be so charmingly and
unreservedly gay. She seemed more like a big sister
than any of the mothers of his acquaintance.
He couldn't remember his own, and while Aunt Letty
was always sweet and good to him he couldn't imagine
her waltzing a dog around on its hind legs any
more than he could imagine Mrs. Martha Washington
doing it.</p>

<p>The holiday tree was another revelation to him,
when he came back at dusk to find it lighted with the
colored lanterns and blooming with flags and hung
with surprises for Georgina and himself.</p>

<p>"You've never seen it lighted," Barby explained,
"and Georgina's birthday had to be skipped because
I wasn't here to celebrate, so we've rolled all the
holidays into one, for a grand celebration in Captain
Kidd's honor."</p>

<p>It was to shorten the time of waiting that Barbara
threw herself into the children's games and pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
so heartily. Every night she tore a leaf off the calendar
and planned something to fill up the next day
to the brim with work or play. They climbed to the
top of the monument when she found that Richard
had never made the ascent, and stood long, looking
off to Plymouth, twenty miles away, and at the town
spread out below them, seeming from their great
height, a tiny toy village. They went to Truro to
see the bayberry candle-dipping. They played Maud
Muller, raking the yard, because the boy whom old
Jeremy had installed in his place had hurt his foot.
Old Jeremy, being well on toward ninety now, no
longer attempted any work, though still hale and
hearty. But the garden had been his especial domain
too long for him to give it up entirely, and
he spent hours in it daily, to the disgust of his easy-going
successor.</p>

<p>There were picnics at Highland Light and the
Race Point life-saving station. There were long
walks out the state road, through the dunes and by
the cranberry bogs. But everything which speeded
Barbara's weeks of feverish waiting, hurrying her
on nearer her heart's desire, brought Richard nearer
to the time of parting from the old seaport town
and the best times he had ever known. He had
kodak pictures of all their outings. Most of them
were light-struck or out of focus or over-exposed,
but he treasured them because he had taken them
himself with his first little Brownie camera. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
was nothing wrong or queer with the recollection of
the scenes they brought to him. His memory photographed
only perfect days, and he dreaded to have
them end.</p>

<p>Before those weeks were over Richard began to
feel that he belonged to Barby in a way, and she to
him. There were many little scenes of which no
snapshot could be taken, which left indelible impressions.</p>

<p>For instance, those evenings in the dim room
lighted only by the moonlight streaming in through
the open windows, when Barby sat at the piano with
Georgina beside her, singing, while he looked out
over the sea and felt the soul of him stir vaguely, as
if he had wings somewhere, waiting to be unfurled.</p>

<p>The last Sunday of his vacation he went to church
with Barbara and Georgina. It wasn't the Church
of the Pilgrims, but another white-towered one near
by. The president of the bank was one of the ushers.
He called Richard by name when he shook
hands with the three of them at the door. That in
itself gave Richard a sense of importance and of
being welcome. It was a plain old-fashioned church,
its only decoration a big bowl of tiger-lilies on a table
down in front of the pulpit. When he took his seat
in one of the high front pews he felt that he had
never been in such a quiet, peaceful place before.</p>

<p>They were very early. The windows were open,
and now and then a breeze blowing in from the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
fluttered the leaves of a hymn-book lying open on the
front seat. Each time they fluttered he heard another
sound also, as faint and sweet as if it were
the ringing of little crystal bells. Georgina, on the
other side of Barby, heard it too, and they looked at
each other questioningly. Then Richard discovered
where the tinkle came from, and pointed upward
to call her attention to it. There, from the center
of the ceiling swung a great, old-fashioned chandelier,
hung with a circle of pendant prisms, each one
as large and shining as the one Uncle Darcy had
given her.</p>

<p>Georgina knew better than to whisper in such a
place, but she couldn't help leaning past Barby so
that Richard could see her lips silently form the
words, "Rainbow Club." She wondered if Mr.
Gates had started it. There were enough prisms
for nearly every member in the church to claim one.</p>

<p>Barby, reading the silent message of her lips and
guessing that Georgina was wondering over the discovery,
moved her own lips to form the words, "just
<i>honorary</i> members."</p>

<p>Georgina nodded her satisfaction. It was good
to know that there were so many of them in the
world, all working for the same end, whether they
realized it or not.</p>

<p>Just before the service began an old lady in the
adjoining pew next to Richard, reached over the partition
and offered him several cloves. He was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
astonished to refuse them and showed them to Barby,
not knowing what to do with them. She leaned down
and whispered behind her fan:</p>

<p>"She eats them to keep her awake in church."</p>

<p>Richard had no intention of going to sleep, but
he chewed one up, finding it so hot it almost strangled
him. Every seat was filled in a short time, and presently
a drowsiness crept into the heated air which
began to weave some kind of a spell around him.
His shoes were new and his collar chafed his neck.
His eyelids grew heavier and heavier. He stared
at the lilies till the whole front of the church seemed
filled with them. He looked up at the chandelier
and began to count the prisms, and watch for the
times that the breeze swept across them and set them
to tinkling.</p>

<p>Then, the next thing that he knew he was waking
from a long doze on Barby's shoulder. She was
fanning him with slow sweeps of her white-feathered
fan which smelled deliciously of some faint perfume,
and the man from Boston was singing all
alone, something about still waves and being brought
into a haven.</p>

<p>A sense of Sabbath peace and stillness enfolded
him, with the beauty of the music and the lilies, the
tinkling prisms, the faint, warm perfume wafted
across his face by Barby's fan. The memory of it
all stayed with him as something very sacred and
sweet, he could not tell why, unless it was that Barby's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
shoulder was such a dear place for a little motherless
lad's head to lie.</p>

<p>Georgina, leaning against Barby on the other
side, half asleep, sat up and straightened her hat
when the anthem began. Being a Huntingdon she
could not turn as some people did and stare up at
the choir loft behind her when that wonderful voice
sang alone. She looked up at the prisms instead,
and as she looked it seemed to her that the voice
was the voice of the white angel Hope, standing
at the prow of a boat, its golden wings sweeping
back, as storm-tossed but triumphant, it brought the
vessel in at last to happy anchorage.</p>

<p>The words which the voice sang were the words
on which the rainbow had rested, that day she read
them to Aunt Elspeth: "<i>So He bringeth them into
their desired haven.</i>" They had seemed like music
then, but now, rolling upward, as if Hope herself
were singing them at the prow of Life's tossing shallop,
they were more than music. They voiced the
joy of great desire finding great fulfilment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NEARING THE END</div>


<div class='cap'>"OLD Mr. Potter has had a stroke."</div>

<p>Georgina called the news up to Richard as
she paused at the foot of the Green Stairs on her
way to the net-mender's house.</p>

<p>"Belle sent a note over a little while ago and I'm
taking the answer back. Come and go with me."</p>

<p>Richard, who had been trundling Captain Kidd
around on his forefeet in the role of wheelbarrow,
dropped the dog's hind legs which he had been using
as handles and came jumping down the steps, two at
a time to do her bidding.</p>

<p>"Belle's gone over to take care of things," Georgina
explained, with an important air as they walked
along. "There's a man to help nurse him, but she'll
stay on to the end." Her tone and words were Tippy's
own as she made this announcement.</p>

<p>"End of what?" asked Richard. "And what's a
stroke?"</p>

<p>Half an hour earlier Georgina could not have answered
his question, but she explained now with the
air of one who has had a lifetime of experience. It
was Mrs. Triplett's fund she was drawing on, however,
and old Jeremy's. Belle's note had started
them to comparing reminiscences, and out of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
conversation Georgina had gathered many gruesome
facts.</p>

<p>"You may be going about as well and hearty as
usual, and suddenly it'll strike you to earth like lightning,
and it may leave you powerless to move for
weeks and sometimes even years. You may know all
that's going on around you but not be able to speak
or make a sign. Mr. Potter isn't as bad as that, but
he's speechless. With him the end may come any
time, yet he may linger on for nobody knows how
long."</p>

<p>Richard had often passed the net-mender's cottage
in the machine, and stared in at the old man
plying his twine-shuttle in front of the door. The
fact that he was Emmett's father and ignorant of
the secret which Richard shared, made an object of
intense interest out of an otherwise unattractive and
commonplace old man. Now that interest grew
vast and overshadowing as the children approached
the house.</p>

<p>Belle, stepping to the front door when she heard
the gate click, motioned for them to go around to
the back. As they passed an open side window, each
looked in, involuntarily attracted by the sight of a
bed drawn up close to it. Then they glanced at each
other, startled and awed by what they saw, and
bumped into each other in their haste to get by as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>On the bed lay a rigid form, stretched out under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
a white counterpane. All that showed of the face
above the bushy whiskers was as waxen looking as
if death had already touched it, but the sunken eyes
half open, showed that they were still in the mysterious
hold of what old Jeremy called a "living
death." It was a sight which neither of them could
put out of their minds for days afterward.</p>

<p>Belle met them at the back door, solemn, unsmiling,
her hushed tones adding to the air of mystery
which seemed to shroud the house. As she finished
reading the note a neighbor came in the back way
and Belle asked the children to wait a few minutes.
They dropped down on the grass while Belle, leaning
against the pump, answered Mrs. Brown's questions
in low tones.</p>

<p>She had been up all night, she told Mrs. Brown.
Yes, she was going to stay on till the call came, no
matter whether it was a week or a year. Mrs. Brown
spoke in a hoarse whisper which broke now and then,
letting her natural voice through with startling effect.</p>

<p>"It's certainly noble of you," she declared.
"There's not many who would put themselves out to
do for an old person who hadn't any claim on them
the way you are doing for him. There'll surely be
stars in <i>your</i> crown."</p>

<p>Later, as the children trudged back home, sobered
by all they had seen and heard, Georgina broke the
silence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I think we ought to put Belle's name on
the very top line of our club book. She ought to be
an honary member&mdash;the very honaryest one of all."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Richard.</p>

<p>"You heard all Mrs. Brown said. Seems to me
what she's doing to give old Mr. Potter a good time
is the very noblest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was an amazed look on Richard's face as
he interrupted with the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Gee-minee! You don't call what that old man's
having a good time, do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's good to what it would be if Belle wasn't
taking care of him. And if she does as Mrs. Brown
says, 'carries some comfort into the valley of the
shadow for him, making his last days bright,' isn't
that the very biggest rainbow anybody could make?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," admitted Richard in a doubtful tone.
"Maybe it is if you put it that way."</p>

<p>They walked a few blocks more in silence, then
he said:</p>

<p>"I think <i>Dan</i> ought to be an honary member."</p>

<p>It was Georgina's turn to ask why.</p>

<p>"Aw, you know why! Taking the blame on himself
the way he did and everything."</p>

<p>"But he made just as bad times for Uncle Darcy
and Aunt Elspeth as he made good times for Mr.
Potter and Emmett. I don't think he has any right
to belong at all."</p>

<p>They argued the question hotly for a few minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
coming nearer to a quarrel than they had ever
been before, and only dropping it as they crossed
to a side street which led into the dunes.</p>

<p>"Let's turn here and go home this way," suggested
Richard. "Let's go look at the place where
we buried the pouch and see if the sand has shifted
any."</p>

<p>Nothing was changed, however, except that the
holes they had dug were filled to the level now, and
the sand stretched an unbroken surface as before the
day of their digging.</p>

<p>"Cousin James says that if ever the gold comes
to the top we can have it, because he paid the woman.
But if it ever does I won't be here to see it. I've
got to go home in eight more days."</p>

<p>He stood kicking his toes into the sand as he
added dolefully, "Here it is the end of the summer
and we've only played at being pirates. We've
never gone after the real stuff in dead earnest, one
single time."</p>

<p>"I know," admitted Georgina. "First we had to
wait so long for your portrait to be finished and
then you went off on the yacht, and all in between
times things have happened so fast there never was
any time. But we found something just as good as
pirate stuff&mdash;that note in the rifle was worth more
to Uncle Darcy than a chest of gold."</p>

<p>"And Captain Kidd was as good as a real pirate,"
said Richard, brightening at the thought, "for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
brought home a bag of real gold, and was the one
who started us after the wild-cat woman. I guess
Uncle Darcy would rather know what she told him
than have a chest of ducats and pearls."</p>

<p>"We can go next summer," suggested Georgina.</p>

<p>"Maybe I won't be here next summer. Dad always
wants to try new places on his vacation. He
and Aunt Letty like to move. But I'd like to stay
here always. I hate to go away until I find out the
end of things. I wish I could stay until the letter is
found and Dan comes home."</p>

<p>"You may be a grown-up man before either of
those things happen," remarked Georgina sagely.</p>

<p>"Then I'll know I'll be here to see 'm," was the
triumphant answer, "because when I'm a man I'm
coming back here to live all the rest of my life. It's
the nicest place there is."</p>

<p>"If anything happens sooner I'll write and tell
you," promised Georgina.</p>

<p>Something happened the very next morning, however,
and Georgina kept part of her promise though
not in writing, when she came running up the Green
Stairs, excited and eager. Her news was so tremendously
important that the words tumbled over
each other in her haste to tell it. She could hardly
make herself understood. The gist of it was that a
long night letter had just arrived from her father,
saying that he had landed in San Francisco and was
taking the first homeward bound train. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
stop in Washington for a couple of days to attend
to some business, and then was coming home for
a long visit. And&mdash;this was the sentence Georgina
saved till last to electrify Richard with:</p>

<p>"<i>Am bringing Dan with me.</i>"</p>

<p>"He didn't say where he found him or anything
else about it," added Georgina, "only 'prepare his
family for the surprise.' So Barby went straight
down there to Fishburn Court and she's telling Aunt
Elspeth and Uncle Darcy now, so they'll have time
to get used to the news before he walks in on them."</p>

<p>They sat down on the top step with the dog between
them.</p>

<p>"They must know it by this time," remarked Georgina.
"Oh, don't you wish you could see what's
happening, and how glad everybody is? Uncle
Darcy will want to start right out with his bell and
ring it till it cracks, telling the whole town."</p>

<p>"But he won't do it," said Richard. "He promised
he wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Anyhow till Belle says he can," amended Georgina.
"I'm sure she'll say so when 'the call' comes,
but nobody knows when that will be. It may be soon
and it may not be for years."</p>

<p>They sat there on the steps a long time, talking
quietly, but with the holiday feeling that one has
when waiting for a procession to pass by. The very
air seemed full of that sense of expectancy, of waiting
for something to happen.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>COMINGS AND GOINGS</div>


<div class='cap'>OUT towards the cranberry bogs went the Towncrier.
No halting step this time, no weary
droop of shoulders. It would have taken a swift-footed
boy to keep pace with him on this errand. He
was carrying the news to Belle. What he expected
her to say he did not stop to ask himself, nor did
he notice in the tumultuous joy which kept his old
heart pounding at unwonted speed, that she turned
white with the suddenness of his telling, and then a
wave of color surged over her face.</div>

<p>Her only answer was to lead him into the room
where the old net-mender lay helpless, turning appealing
eyes to her as she entered, with the look
in them that one sees in the eyes of a grateful dumb
animal. His gaze did not reach as far as the Towncrier,
who halted on the threshold until Belle joined
him there. She led him outside.</p>

<p>"You see for yourself how it is," was all she said.
"Do as you think best about it."</p>

<p>Out on the road again the Towncrier stood hesitating,
uncertain which course to take. Twice he
started in the direction of home, then retraced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
steps again to stand considering. Finally he straightened
up with a determined air and started briskly
down the road which led to the center of the town.
Straight to the bank he went, asking for Mr. Gates,
and a moment later was admitted into the president's
private office.</p>

<p>"And what can I do for you, Uncle Dan'l?" was
the cordial greeting.</p>

<p>The old man dropped heavily into the chair set
out for him. He was out of breath from his rapid
going.</p>

<p>"You can do me one of the biggest favors I ever
asked of anybody if you only will. Do you remember
a sealed envelope I brought in here the first of
the summer and asked you to keep for me till I
called for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do you want it now?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to show you what's in it."</p>

<p>He had such an air of suppressed excitement as he
said it and his breathing was so labored, that Mr.
Gates wondered what could have happened to affect
him so. When he came back from the vault he carried
the envelope which had been left in his charge
earlier in the summer. Uncle Darcy tore it open
with fingers that trembled in their eagerness.</p>

<p>"What I'm about to show you is for your eyes
alone," he said. He took out a crumpled sheet of
paper which had once been torn in two and pasted
together again in clumsy fashion. It was the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
which had been wadded up in the rifle, which Belle
had seized with hysterical fury, torn in two and
flung from her.</p>

<p>"There! Read that!" he commanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates knew everybody in town. He had been
one of the leading citizens who had subscribed to
the monument in Emmett Potter's honor. He could
scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyes as he
read the confession thrust into his hands, and he had
never been more surprised at any tale ever told him
than the one Uncle Darcy related now of the way
it had been found, and his promise to Belle Triplett.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to make it public while old Potter
hangs on," he said in conclusion. "I'll wait till he's
past feeling the hurts of earth. But Mr. Gates, I've
had word that my Danny's coming home. I can't
let the boy come back to dark looks and cold shoulders
turned on him everywhere. I thought if you'd
just start the word around that he's all right&mdash;that
somebody else confessed to what he's accused of&mdash;that
you'd seen the proof with your own eyes and
could vouch for his being all right&mdash;if <i>you'd</i> just
give him a welcoming hand and show you believed in
him it would make all the difference in the world in
Danny's home-coming. You needn't mention any
names," he pleaded. "I know it'll make a lot of talk
and surmising, but that won't hurt anybody. If
you could just do that&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>When the old man walked out of the president's
office he carried his head as high as if he had been
given a kingdom. He had been given what was
worth more to him, the hearty handclasp of a man
whose "word was as good as a bond," and the promise
that Dan should be welcomed back to the town
by great and small, as far as was in his power to
make that welcome cordial and widespread.</p>

<div class='center'><b>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>Dan did not wait in Washington while Doctor
Huntingdon made his report. He came on alone,
and having missed the boat, took the railroad journey
down the Cape. In the early September twilight
he stepped off the car, feeling as if he were in
a strange dream. But when he turned into one of
the back streets leading to his home, it was all so
familiar and unchanged that he had the stranger
feeling of never having been away. It was the past
ten years that seemed a dream.</p>

<p>He had not realized how he loved the old town
or the depth of his longing for it, until he saw it
now, restored to him. Even the familiar, savory
smells floating out from various supper tables as he
passed along, gave him keen enjoyment. Some of
them had been unknown all the time of his wanderings
in foreign lands. The voices, the type of features,
the dress of the people he passed, the veriest
trifles which he never noticed when he lived among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
them, thrilled him now with a sense of having come
back to his own.</p>

<p>Half a dozen fishermen passed him, their boots
clumping heavily. He recognized two of them if not
as individuals, as members of families he had known,
from their resemblance to the older ones. Then he
turned his head aside as he reached the last man.
He was not ready to be recognized himself, yet. He
wanted to go home first, and this man at the end
was Peter Winn. He had sailed in his boat many
a time.</p>

<p>A cold fog was settling over the Court when he
turned into it. As silently as the fog itself he stole
through the sand and in at the gate. The front door
was shut and the yellow blind pulled down over the
window, but the lamp behind it sent out a glow,
reaching dimly through the fog. He crept up close
to it to listen for the sound of voices, and suddenly
two blended shadows were thrown on the blind. The
old man was helping his wife up from her rocking
chair and supporting her with a careful arm as he
guided her across to the table. His voice rang out
cheerfully to the waiting listener.</p>

<p>"That's it, Mother! That's it! Just one more
step now. Why, you're doing fine! I knew the word
of Danny's coming home would put you on your feet
again. The lad'll be here soon, thank God! Maybe
before another nightfall."</p>

<p>A moment later and the lamp-light threw another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
shadow on the yellow blind, plain as a photograph.
It was well that the fog drew a white veil between it
and the street, for it was a picture of joy too sacred
for curious eyes to see.</p>

<p><i>Danny had come home!</i></p>

<div class='center'><b>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>It was the tenth of September. The town looked
strangely deserted with nearly all the summer people
gone. The railroad wharf was the only place where
there was the usual bustle and crowd, and that was
because the <i>Dorothy Bradford</i> was gathering up its
passengers for the last trip of the season.</p>

<p>Richard was to be one of them, and a most unwilling
one. Not that he was sorry to be going back
to school. He had missed Binney and the gang,
and could hardly wait to begin swapping experiences
with them. But he was leaving Captain Kidd behind.
Dogs were not allowed in the apartment house
to which his father and Aunt Letty intended moving
the next week.</p>

<p>There had been a sorry morning in the garage
when the news was broken to him. He crept up into
the machine and lay down on the back seat, and cried
and cried with his arms around Captain Kidd's
neck. The faithful little tongue reached out now
and then to lap away his master's tears, and once he
lifted his paw and clawed at the little striped shirt
waist as if trying to convey some mute comfort.</p>

<p>"You're just the same as folks!" sobbed Richard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
hugging the shaggy head, laid lovingly on his breast.
"And it's <i>cruel</i> of 'em to make me give you away."</p>

<p>Several days had passed since that unhappy morning,
however, and Richard did not feel quite so desolate
over the separation now. For one thing it had
not been necessary to give up all claim on Captain
Kidd to insure him a good home. Georgina had
gladly accepted the offer of half of him, and had
coaxed even Tippy into according him a reluctant
welcome.</p>

<p>The passengers already on deck watched with interest
the group near the gang-plank. Richard was
putting the clever little terrier through his whole list
of tricks.</p>

<p>"It's the last time, old fellow," he said imploringly
when the dog hesitated over one of them. "Go
on and do it for me this once. Maybe I'll never see
you again till I'm grown up and you're too old to remember
me."</p>

<p>"That's what you said about Dan's coming home,"
remarked Georgina from under the shade of her
pink parasol. That parasol and the pink dress and
the rose-like glow on the happy little face was attracting
even more admiration from the passengers
than Captain Kidd's tricks. Barbara, standing beside
her, cool and dainty in a white dress and pale
green sweater and green parasol, made almost as
much of a picture.</p>

<p>"You talked that way about never expecting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
see Danny till you were grown," continued Georgina,
"and it turned out that you not only saw him,
but were with him long enough to hear some of his
adventures. It would be the same way about your
coming back here if you'd just keep hoping hard
enough."</p>

<p>"Come Dicky," called Mr. Moreland from the
upper deck. "They're about to take in the gang-plank.
Don't get left."</p>

<p>Maybe it was just as well that there was no time
for good-byes. Maybe it was more than the little
fellow could have managed manfully. As it was his
voice sounded suspiciously near breaking as he called
back over his shoulder, almost gruffly:</p>

<p>"Well you&mdash;you be as good to my half of him
as you are to yours."</p>

<p>A moment or two later, leaning over the railing
of the upper deck he could see Captain Kidd struggling
and whining to follow him. But Barby held
tightly to the chain fastened to his collar, and Georgina,
her precious pink parasol cast aside, knelt on
the wharf beside the quivering, eager little body to
clasp her arms about it and pour out a flood of comforting
endearments.</p>

<p>Wider and wider grew the stretch of water between
the boat and the wharf. Richard kept on
waving until he could no longer distinguish the little
group on the end of the pier. But he knew they
would be there until the last curl of smoke from the
steamer disappeared around Long Point.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here," said the friendly voice of a woman standing
next to him. She had been one of the interested
witnesses of the parting. She thrust an opera-glass
into his hands. For one more long satisfying moment
he had another glimpse of the little group, still
faithfully waving, still watching. How very, very
far away they were!</p>

<p>Suddenly the glass grew so blurry and queer it
was no more good, and he handed it back to the
woman. At that moment he would have given all
the pirate gold that was ever on land or sea, were it
his to give, to be back on that pier with the three of
them, able to claim that old seaport town as his
home for ever and always. And then the one thing
that it had taught him came to his help. With his
head up, he looked back to the distant shore where
the Pilgrim monument reared itself like a watchful
giant, and said hopefully, under his breath:</p>

<p>"Well, <i>some day!</i>"</p>

<div class='center'><b>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</b></div>

<p>Georgina, waking earlier than usual that September
morning, looked up and read the verse on the
calendar opposite her bed, which she had read every
morning since the month came in.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Like ships my days sail swift to port,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I know not if this be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The one to bear a cargo rare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of happiness to me."</span></i><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I <i>do</i> know this time," she thought exultingly,
sitting up in bed to look out the window and see what
kind of weather the dawn had brought. This was
the day her father was coming home. He was coming
from Boston on a battleship, and she and Barby
were going out to meet him as soon as it was sighted
in the harbor.</p>

<p>She had that quivery, excited feeling which sometimes
seizes travelers as they near the journey's end,
as if she herself were a little ship, putting into a
long-wished-for port. Well, it would be like that in
a way, she thought, to have her father's arms folded
around her, to come at last into the strange, sweet
intimacy she had longed for ever since she first saw
Peggy Burrell and the Captain.</p>

<p>And it was reaching another long-desired port
to have Barby's happiness so complete. As for
Uncle Darcy he said himself that he couldn't be
gladder walking the shining streets of heaven, than
he was going along that old board-walk with Danny
beside him, and everybody so friendly and so pleased
to see him.</p>

<p>Georgina still called him Danny in her thoughts,
but it had been somewhat a shock the first time she
saw him, to find that he was a grown man with a
grave, mature face, instead of the boy which Uncle
Darcy's way of speaking of him had led her to expect.
He had already been up to the house to tell
them the many things they were eager to know about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the months he had spent with Doctor Huntingdon
and their long trip home together. And listening,
Georgina realized how very deep was the respect
and admiration of this younger man for her father
and his work, and everything he said made her
more eager to see and know him.</p>

<p>Uncle Darcy and Dan were with them when they
put out in the motor boat to meet the battleship. It
was almost sunset when they started, and the man
at the wheel drove so fast they felt the keen whip
of the wind as they cut through the waves. They
were glad to button their coats, even up to their
chins. Uncle Darcy and Dan talked all the way
over, but Georgina sat with her hand tightly locked
in her mother's, sharing her tense expectancy, never
saying a word.</p>

<p>Then at last the little boat stopped alongside the
big one. There were a few moments of delay before
Georgina looked up and saw her father coming down
to them. He was just as his photograph had pictured
him, tall, erect, commanding, and strangely
enough her first view of him was with his face turned
to one side. Then it was hidden from her as he
gathered Barby into his arms and held her close.</p>

<p>Georgina, watching that meeting with wistful,
anxious eyes, felt her last little doubt of him vanish,
and when he turned to her with his stern lips curved
into the smile she had hoped for, and with outstretched
arms, she sprang into them and threw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
arms around his neck with such a welcoming clasp
that his eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Then, remembering certain little letters which he
had re-read many times on his homeward voyage,
he held her off to look into her eyes and whisper with
a tender smile which made the teasing question a
joy to her:</p>

<p>"Which is it now? 'Dear Sir' or 'Dad-o'-my-heart?'"</p>

<p>The impetuous pressure of her soft little cheek
against his face was answer eloquent enough.</p>

<p>As they neared the shore a bell tolled out over
the water. It was the bell of Saint Peter, patron
saint of the fisher-folk and all those who dwell by
the sea. Then Long Point lighthouse flashed a welcome,
and the red lamp of Wood End blinked in
answer. On the other side Highland Light sent its
great, unfailing glare out over the Atlantic, and the
old Towncrier, looking up, saw the first stars shining
overhead.</p>

<p>Alongshore the home lights began to burn. One
shone out in Fishburn Court where Aunt Elspeth
sat waiting. One threw its gleam over the edge of
the cranberry bog from the window where Belle
kept faithful vigil&mdash;where she would continue to
keep it until "the call" came to release the watcher
as well as the stricken old soul whose peace she
guarded. And up in the big gray house by the break-water,
where Tippy was keeping supper hot, a supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
fit to set before a king, lights blazed from every
window.</p>

<p>Pondering on what all these lights stood for, the
old man moved away from the others, and took his
place near the prow. His heart was too full just
now to talk as they were doing. Presently he felt a
touch on his arm. Georgina had laid her hand on it
with the understanding touch of perfect comradeship.
They were his own words she was repeating
to him, but they bore the added weight of her own
experience now.</p>

<p>"It <i>pays</i> to keep Hope at the prow, Uncle Darcy."</p>

<p>"Aye, lass," he answered tremulously, "it does."</p>

<p>"And we're coming into port with all flags flying!"</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> we are!"</p>

<p>She stood in silent gladness after that, the rest
of the way, her curls flying back in the wind made by
the swift motion of the boat, the white spray dashing
up till she could taste the salt of it on her lips; a little
figure of Hope herself, but of Hope riding
triumphantly into the port of its fulfillment. It was
for them all&mdash;those words of the old psalm on which
the rainbow had rested, and which the angel voice
had sung&mdash;"<i>Into their desired haven.</i>"</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
